1996,"Perhaps Not such a Good Idea
I have found trying to run a blog is very time-consuming, and there are other calls on my time. I think it has been demonstrated that if enough people are unable to self-moderate, the nuggets of interest are swamped by the rubbish. Sadly I agree with Mark Frank's assessment. I had hoped more thread topics would be proposed nothing has been suggested by anyone for a while.
My personal view is that, considering DaveScot's generally perceived blog persona, I have to admit that he hasn't been (on this site) quite the unmitigated disaster predicted. John Davison, on the other hand has conformed perfectly to predictions, which is a shame, but his choice.
I am happy to let things run for a while, but would like to hear from anyone who has a suggestion for a thread topic. Post here or in the suggestions thread

How about an ""ID: show me the research"" thread?
OK Rich, put some meat on the bones and I'll paste it.
Of course I have. I have no respect for you or your cronies from Psnda's Thumb. What did you expect kudos? What do you want another thread for? No one has even attempted to answer my four challenges yet. You know why? I do. It is because they can't, because everything you and your Darwimpian cronies stand for is a myth, an illusion and a hoax. That's why. You might as well close down this flame pit while you are behind as it isn't going anywhere.
It is hard to believe isn't it?
I love it so!

Why is there no ID research, even on Dembski's blog?
Why does ID consist solely of an opinion that some parts of human biology are designed?
How would IDers actually prove that some parts of human biology are in fact designed?
Expand a bit on the theme, Wonderpants and I'll start a thread if you like.
""My personal view is that, considering DaveScot's generally perceived blog persona, I have to admit that he hasn't been (on this site) quite the unmitigated disaster predicted. ""
At a guess, it's because he can't duck or delete awkward subjects. I note from skimming through the threads though that he's been rather selective as to which ones he posts in, namely the ones that don't pose awkward ID questions. ;-)
Well, we can't torture a confession out of him. As Lenny points out frequently, an absence of an answer is in itself an answer. What about a thread from you, entitled "" My awkard questions for DaveScot""?
I'm not sure how much meat can be put on the bones of a non-existent project, but here's my thought:
I would really like to hear about actual research projects that can be / are being done. Without knowing of any that are running currently, I'm not sure if it would be a good thread to start, but maybe you could ask for ideas.
It could be a thread dedicated to lab experiments. If X is designed, we will find Y. Here's how we find Y in the lab. Then we watch for the landslide of X and Y that get suggested and, of course, the methods that actually find these things.
Why would they start posting it now, though, after years of keeping it secret?
JAD: I have no respect for you or your cronies from Psnda's Thumb.
Which raises the obvious question of why you hang around in forums like this. Why not submit your work to a technical journal where real scientists will read it?
Well, unless and until Wonderpants or Blipey want to expand on it, I have framed a thread along the line suggested.
I think a good thread would be ""Place A Vote For or Against the Banning of Professor Emeritus John Davison"".
I invade the ephemeral meaningless world of cyberdom for amusement on the outside chance that I might find a rational mind once in a while, one like johndarius for example. Mostly I encounter mentally impaired ideologues with IQs in the room temperature range or hostile, rabid, certifiably deranged schizophrenic sociopaths like Spravid Dinger. This particular blog seems to be blessed with both varieties.

I love it so!
I'll try and think of something tomorrow.
Been watching the footie tonight.
Props to France for winning aghainst Spain, Alan.
Ah, the World Cup. Something else Mrs Fox and I disagree on. Yes there would have been a few glum faces at work tomorrow. Now if only France can beat Brazil, and England beat Portugal.
JAD, you didn't answer my second question: Why not submit your work to a technical journal where real scientists will read it?
Why would real scientists want to read the nonsensical ramblings of a pseudoscientist?
Give me a shout if you need some ""help.""
Naturally -
I love it so!
But JAD won't publish in a scientific journal any longer. According to his second post, we can assume that he visits Nature's website ""for amusement on the outside chance that [he] might find a rational mind once in a while, one like a [creationist] for example. Mostly [he] encounters mentally impaired [evolutionary biologists] ""
I can't think of a single great scientist who wouldn't describe himself as a creationist, not one. Can anyone?
I love it so!
Democritus, Sagan, Darwin, Edison, Feynman, Curie, just to name a handful.
Of course, they never managed to publish in Rivista... [snicker]
Feynman once described scientific discovery as a religious experience. I agree entirely as I have had the same experience. That anyone could describe Darwin as a scientist is unthinkable. I didn't know that about Curie and tend not to accept it without some documentation.
I love it so!
What a sad little weasel you are. Feynman was an avowed atheist. Curie was raised Catholic but became an atheist on the death of her mother. Darwin was 100 times the scientist you are.
Creationism is all but dead among true scientists; critical inquiry is poison to that superstitious twaddle.",What is the author's personal view on DaveScot's blog persona?,"The author's personal view is that, considering DaveScot's generally perceived blog persona, he hasn't been quite the unmitigated disaster predicted on the site."

Sure.I think you might recheck some of your math. Not sure but some totals look low. Don't trust the posted weightof gear, weigh it yourself if you haven't.Why is your pack list so heavy?
I agree, nice looking blog. Bill is right on listing the sizes, other than that....looks great!
Brett - nice list, and nice format!(One small typo: it currently says ""Cloudburt"" for the tent.)

Great site with good info. I'm trying to decide between the GoLite Infinity and Jam and I think after reading your blog, that the Jam should be plenty big.I'm interested to see what's in your first aid kit.Also, any issues with the water purification tablets? I currently use a MSR miniworks pump and I'm looking to lighten up...
At first I thought you might not be warm enough as I reviewed your North Cascade hike, then I recounted your layers. Very nice site! What I was a little confused about was the opening statement of getting four days of backpacking gear into a pack, yet at the bottom the food for two was estimated for three days. However I now understand that these are not mutually exclusive statements.
thanks for the feedback.i fixed the cloudburt typo (thanks), and the 4 vs. 3 days. ai also completed all my gear posts - including the innards of my first aid kit and my experiences with the MicroPUR tabs.the weights listed should be the ones that i weighed myself (unless, i've mis-typed in some areas)bill - you say to check my math with ""Why is your pack list so heavy?"". not sure what you are refering to here.great idea on including the sizes.

On our way to Prijedor, one of the major cities in north-eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina, my host points out over the green, mountainous, and sunlit landscape and tells me: “Right over there behind those houses, they just found a new mass grave”. A couple of minutes later he explains that the men found in the grave are probably the men missing from the village up on the hill in front of us, since there are still so many unsolved cases. It is October 2013 and the International Commission for Missing Persons (ICMP) has just discovered one of the largest mass graves of the Bosnian war (1992-1995) nearby the small town of Tomašica, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The mass grave had the size of a football field, measured some 10 meters deep, and would, according to officials, hold the remains of around 1,000 Bosniak and Croat men, women, and children – as several media outlets reported. Until now, 435 bodies have been recovered from the grave of which 284 have been identified and buried in July 2014. According to the numbers of the ICMP, from the 30,000 persons that were registered as missing person at the end of the Bosnian war, so far 22,000 persons have been accounted for. A large number of the remaining missing persons are from the region where this mass grave was found, the Krajina. The big and looming question that remains: how could it take 18 years for such a mass grave, a couple of hundred meters from local houses, to be found?
“The issue of missing persons can only be solved if the local community changes their attitude regarding the war crime that was committed” (Karčić 2013). The grave at Tomašica is located close to the border between the Republika Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the two entities in which Bosnia and Herzegovina is split up after the signing of the Dayton Peace Agreements in 1995. During the war, Prijedor (which was to be included in the Republika Srpska) and its surroundings saw ethnic cleansing taking place on a massive scale – with as many as 52,000 non-Serbs being forcibly expelled from Prijedor’s total 120,000 pre-war residents. Three of the largest and most notorious concentration camps during the Bosnian war (Trnopolje, Omarska, and Keraterm) were located in the city’s vicinity. Professor Pettigrew (professor of Philosophy, Southern Connecticut State University) writes: “The mass graves are a testament to the genocide that was committed in Bosnia, as well as to the failure of the authorities of the Republika Srpska, as part of their genocide denial, to reveal their location”. Perhaps this must be seen as the most poignant explanation for the fact that not one individual living in the surroundings of Tomašica (and, for that matter, other mass graves) found it appropriate to notify local and international investigators about the existence of it. The three mutually exclusive narratives (that of the Bosnian Serbs, Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Muslims) about what happened during the war, who started it, and who is to blame, keep on being perpetuated in Bosnian society today. One of the key ingredients of the Bosnian Serb narrative is the denial of genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina – hence the denial of the existence of mass graves since that would counter fact their story.
With the finding of mass graves and the uncovering of new facts, the search for truth is continued – often even revitalized. On December 13, 2014, local as well as international media reported that 15 Bosnian Serbs have been indicted for crimes against humanity over an attack on a village near Prijedor in 1992. During this attack, 150 Bosniak men, women, and children were killed and their bodies dumped in the Tomašica mass grave. Prosecutors at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) have desperately tried to reopen their case after the Tomašica-site was found, especially the cases of the so-called ‘big fish’. For the trial against the former Bosnian Serb politician Radovan Karadžić it was too late. However in the case of Ratko Mladić, former Bosnian Serb military leader, new forensic evidence stemming from the mass grave has recently been tendered.
The challenges with the search for missing persons is not unique for Bosnia and Herzegovina. Forced disappearances are rife in conflicts and are often used as an explicit tactic of war. They wreak havoc on families and certain villages in Bosnia were left after the war without any male inhabitants. Besides the grief these families have to live through, such circumstances have high economic consequences for rural, patriarchal societies where the male is the main breadwinner. In the Bosnian film Snijeg (unfortunately only available online without subtitles) the ramifications of such a situation are vividly put to life on the big screen.
This year, 2015, the 20th commemoration of the ending of the Bosnian war will be held – the silence of those missing looming over the ceremonies. For the people in the small village up on that hill in north-eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina, that is what is happening now.

- OK, look, I know we’re all disgusted at a big loss to a badly injured bottom feeder like Buffalo. But it’s important not to get overly caught up in the post facto narrative your brain is going to create as it looks through the lens of that putrid score.
- The truth is that the Oilers had a sh*t ton of great chances, and whiffed on a bunch of them. And the few they didn’t whiff on were mostly stopped.
- The Sabres on the other hand had fewer and less dangerous chances, but seemingly scored on all of them (and by my count, scored on three that weren’t really chances at all!)
- Make no mistake, these were two world-class tire fires going at it, and the Oilers have a lot to clean up, just as they did after the Flames victories. But the Sabres were by far the larger and stinkier of the two tire fires. Rewatch the game if you don’t believe me (I’m doing that right now to confirm my post game comments, and yes, it hurts a lot).
- The truth is, we see this kind of thing regularly – goaltending extremes will pretty much always override whatever happens with the rest of the team. What I mean by that is that great goaltending will overcome a huge deficit in play, and bad goaltending will torch a big advantage in play. And the latter is what happened tonight.
- What’s that old saying? “Goaltending is 50% of the game – unless you don’t have it, in which case it’s 100%”. Yup.
- On a side note, the reffing was horrific, as it always is when Tim Peel is soiling the ice with his presence. But that’s not why the Oilers lost.

In the third at 5 on 3 the point shot bounds off the boards and goes to six of net where Talbot pad stops it. This about the 6:50 mark.
Pretty sure that puck goes in. Even worse for Talbots night.
I wonder, are you able to get that clip? Talbots glove hides where the puck is and he slips it out.
Hmm, interesting. Let me take a look, I think I have a way to capture it as a clip if so
Yeah, I think I see what you mean around 7:00 left. it’s certainly possible it might have been over the line, but as you say, it looks like Talbot’s glove is covering it so can’t be called anyway. Of course, officials have disallowed an Oiler goal where it was visibly over the line and not covered, so I wouldn’t put it past them to call a covered puck a goal against!",Who were the three stars in the NHL game between Buffalo Sabres and Edmonton Oilers?,"The three stars were Ryan O’Reilly, Brian Gionta, and Leon Draisaitl."

While news of the soon-to-begin travel bubble with Australia has been met with excitement by travel lovers and people with family over the ditch, the agriculture sector is hoping it will lead to more foreign workers being allowed into the country.
On Tuesday Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced the bubble - which means quarantine-free travel between New Zealand and Australia - will begin on April 19.
The Government says doing away with quarantine for those arriving from Australia will free up between 1000 and 1300 rooms per fortnight in managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) facilities.
Although around 500 of those spaces will be kept as ""contingency should they be needed for the trans-Tasman arrangement"", the bubble means there are now hundreds of more places available in MIQ.
Now, with many primary industries continuing to face severe labour shortages, there are calls for those free spaces to go to foreign workers in the farming, horticulture and viticulture sectors.
""MIQ spacing has been continually quoted as a barrier for getting the workers we need,"" Federated Farmers immigration spokesperson Chris Lewis said on Wednesday.
""With more beds becoming available [the Government] should now allow those with agricultural skills to enter the country.""
Lewis said Federated Farmers acknowledged the Government had already made some limited border exceptions for agricultural machinery operators, veterinarians, sheep shearers, animal pregnancy scanners and some skilled dairy staff. However, ""these limited exceptions aren't going to go very far with the number of workers needed across the primary industries in the coming months,"" he said.
""With continued low unemployment and the majority of available workers remaining in the urban centres, all of the primary industries are crying out for labour.""
Mike Chapman, chief executive of Horticulture New Zealand, told Newshub he was also hopeful some of the free MIQ spots would go to migrant agriculture workers.
Although the Government granted border exemptions for 2000 recognised seasonal employer (RSE) workers from Pacific countries, that only went a small way to covering the total shortfall of between 5000 and 10,000 workers the industry faced during the peak harvest period.
It's estimated the lack of workers will cost the sector hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, with the labour shortage forcing many growers to leave fruit to rot on trees.
Chapman said the agreement with Australia is a ""good start"" but even if some of the MIQ places do go to workers in the horticulture industry, it comes too late to help growers during the busy harvest period.
However, he said, ""in terms of winter pruning it's not too late"".
""If there was some movement through these spaces at MIQ it would be a great assistance to the winter pruning and also it would flow through into the spring crop,"" he said.
""So it would be an enormous assistance.""
But while it is important to get workers into the country in time for winter, Chapman said the real focus was avoiding another labour shortage next harvest season.
""To avoid what happened this year we really need to go back to making the RSE scheme work as it always has - a two-way flow of workers up to the cap of 14,400.""
He said the best way for that to happen was through vaccinations and ""a new system that doesn't involve MIQ"".
When asked about the issue on Wednesday, Agriculture Minister Damien O'Connor told reporters he ""certainly will be advocating for more RSE workers to be brought in"" if there is an opportunity to do so.
""We'll certainly be putting forward the case that should there be any MIQ space available from the trans-Tasman bubble that some of those places be available for horticulture and agriculture workers,"" he said.
However, that would have to be balanced by the fact there are still many New Zealanders wanting to come home as well as other sectors calling for essential workers to be given access to MIQ facilities, he said.
COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said a decision on how to best utilise the extra MIQ rooms was likely later this month.
""The Government will consider the best ways to use the remaining rooms over the coming weeks, including the option of finding more places for people from the Pacific, including the RSE workforce,"" Hipkins said in a statement to Newshub.
""[Immigration] Minister [Kris] Faafoi continues to engage with the horticulture and wine sectors around workforce needs, and he reiterates that industries put together plans to better attract New Zealanders and onshore migrants into work.""",What is the expected impact of the travel bubble between New Zealand and Australia on the agriculture sector in New Zealand?,"The agriculture sector in New Zealand is hoping that the travel bubble with Australia will lead to more foreign workers being allowed into the country. The travel bubble means quarantine-free travel between New Zealand and Australia, which will free up between 1000 and 1300 rooms per fortnight in managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) facilities.

TOP 10 WAYS TO LOSE ONLINE BUSINESS
10. Don’t market and advertise your page or site properly and effectively.
Word of mouth is just the beginning of getting the word out to potential prospects and clients. Linking to your site from every possible social network and profile on the web is an often missed opportunity by many. Adding links in your email signatures has never proven to hurt. Not understanding and maximizing SEO may be the greatest missed opportunity.
9. Use controversial content that creates “camps” or makes people choose “in” or “out!”
Your opinions and expressed feelings regarding Politics, Religion, and a variety of other topics can and will create a parting of the ways with much of your traffic if you’re not careful. Avoiding the “like” versus “Don’t Like” or “I’m with you” vs “Against You” is advice I hear often from successful professionals online. Don’t make readers choose a camp, because it may not be yours.
8. Spend too much time just playing on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks.
If you poke 3o people a day on Facebook, that’s nice. If you tell everyone following you on Twitter your play-by-play plans for the day and share photos of every image your eyeballs land on, that’s really cool. If you’ve signed up on over 15+ social networks and feel guilty that you haven’t visited each one and updated your status, you may want to get help. STOP IT! Your business comes first!!
7. Focusing on making money instead of providing value-added content.
Sell, Sell, Sell. Me, Me, Me! This won’t work off-line, and it certainly won’t work online. Providing value with absolutely no expectation of anything in return over time will produce relationships which are necessary if you ever want to do business. This doesn’t mean to give up the farm and all your goods, just use a strategy that builds like, trust, and a rapport. The rest will fall into place when you connect and meet IRL. (In Real Life)
6. Trying to build traffic and analytics instead of building quality relationships.
Some people get very excited about the amount of traffic their sites and blogs generate every hour, day, and month. They feel and believe that just because they are on the first page of the search engines for certain keywords and phrases that they are successful. Even with 500 hits to your site an hour, if you haven’t created or built one single relationship, then what is the point? Don’t count hits, count trips to the bank.
5. Don’t know your markets, your products, your tools, and your service areas.
Let me look into that for you… I’m not sure? Hmmm… that’s a great question? Let me see, not sue what I can do? Not sure if that’s an option. What does that mean and where did you hear that? Are you kidding me, are you nuts? These are all comments and signs that you may want to know a little more about your market, product, business, or service. You are the expert, it’s no different when your doctor says… “Hmm… I’ve never heard of that before…” Yikes!
4. Lack in response time to online contacts. The sting and power of the 1st hour.
100% of online contacts have the option of being mobile and 100% of people usually are. What percentage of people want to “WAIT” to hear back from you for any reason at all? NONE. This is why text messaging has become the fastest and most popular way for the world to communicate. It is the number one communication tool besides face-to-face and the phone. Answer your phone. Respond to email quickly, and new online contacts will often wait 3-5 minutes before they’re gone… FOREVER!!
3. Not using a good CRM to manage campaigns and follow-up with online contacts.
If you can’t remember what you ate for breakfast, lunch, and dinner two weeks ago on Thursday, then there is no way on earth you’re going to remember what you’re suppose to do two weeks from tomorrow at 10am, 1pm, and 7:30pm regarding your business, clients, follow-up, or personal life. Most people can’t even remember what to get at the grocery store so they bring their Retail CRM with them. (The Shopping List) You NEED a “shopping list” for your business as well.
2. No call-to-action or method and form of contact capture.
Your website may get hundreds of hits. Your various blogs may have thousands of readers and subscribers. Your real estate MLS or IDX might produce millions of visitors but if you have no form of contact capture or call to action, then why even bother being online, spending the time, money, and effort to build your online presence and empire? It’s ok to give information and share value-added content but don’t throw out the baby with the bath water. Use multiple and creative ways to capture contacts.

Active Substance(s) : Hyaluronic acid
Strength : 25mg/ml, 3mg/ml
Pack Size : 2-1.2ml prefilled syringes
Accessories : Package insert, 4-25G 1/2” needles, 4 traceability labels
Filorga Art Filler Volume is a facial volumizing, contouring, and rehydrating injectable dermal filler. This formula is crafted with Tri-Hyal technology, a ground-breaking anti-aging concept that combines 3 types of cross-linked hyaluronic acid for ultimate correction.
You can order Filorga Art Filler Volume at wholesale prices from Doctormedica online. You can also call, fax, or email us to place an order today. For detailed information on our ordering and shipping processes, visit our website.
Each box of Filorga Art Filler Volume contains 2 pre-filled syringes, 4-25G1” sterile single-use needles, a package insert, and 4 traceability labels.
The unique texture of this dermal filler enables it to effectively volumize, hydrate, and contour facial skin, eliminating fine lines for a smooth, beautifully sculpted look. Its specialized form of hyaluronic acid ensures that it improves both the appearance and the quality of treated skin, leaving patients with incredible, long-lasting results. It has also been proven to stimulate the production of collagen and elastin, increasing overall skin health.
This formula contains Tri-hyal hyaluronic acid, giving it added smoothing potential. This solution also contains about 0.3% licodaine, a local anesthetic.
Filorga Art Filler Volume is made of 3 different forms of hyaluronic acid, each of which has a unique molecular weight. This allows it to steadily and evenly volumize the skin, as well as effectively sculpt and contour the face.
Hyaluronic acid occurs naturally in the body, where it nourishes skin by helping it to retain moisture. However, throughout the aging process, this natural supply is depleted. This causes the skin to become dry, wrinkled, and sallow. Luckily, by injecting hyaluronic acid back into aging skin, Filorga Art Filler Volume plumps and hydrates at a cellular level, filling out the facial features.
Only qualified medical professionals may perform this treatment. Prior to administration, disinfect the area to be treated and assemble the syringe following proper aseptic guidelines. Depending on the area to be treated, the proper injection technique and amount of filler to be used will vary based on practitioner preference. After injection, the treated region should be massaged to ensure uniform distribution of the product.
Each treatment session with Filorga Art Filler Volume will take between 30 minutes and 1 hour to complete, depending on the severity of correction required.
This dermal filler can be used to increase facial volume and add density to skin, as well as for sculpting the facial features. Due to the hydrating properties of hyaluronic acid, it also moisturizes skin at the cellular level.
Filorga Art Filler Volume with Lidocaine is ideal for use on the face.
Filorgas Art Filler Volume has exceptional durability. At 9 months after the initial treatment, a top-up treatment should be administered to extend the implant’s life to 18 months. Please note that results may vary from patient to patient based on their age, health, and metabolism.
By ordering Art Filler Volume online directly from Doctormedica, you may take advantage of our wholesale prices to ensure that your patients get the results they desire—at the lowest possible price point. This dermal filler will rehydrate their skin, add natural-looking volume, and sculpt the face, leaving patients’ features looking not only plump and beautifully defined, but moisturized and healthy.
This filler is intended for patients who are experiencing noticeable signs of aging, with sagging and general volume loss occurring in their cheeks and other facial areas.
Certain patients should not use this filler, despite its generally high safety profile. These include pregnant and breastfeeding women; individuals with autoimmune or bleeding disorders; patients with a hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in this formulation; and patients who are prone to keloid scarring.
After injection, many patients experience some mild swelling, bruising, redness, and irritation at the treatment site. However, these side effects rarely escalate, and genuinely disappear within days. In rare cases, patients may experience more serious adverse reactions, such as hypersensitivity, granuloma formation, and skin necrosis. If these issues occur, immediate medical attention is required. To ensure your patients’ safety, please consult the included product leaflet for more information on potential complications, contraindications, and warnings associated with this treatment.

1021,"Friday Report Card: Butler Locks Up the Horizon
A - Luke Harangody
I don't care that ND lost to Louisville last night.. or that Harangody isn't the best looking guy out there.. or that the Irish haven't won any huge road games. The simple fact of the matter is that Harangody has to be the Big East Player of the Year. His 40 point, 12 rebound effort last night was just one in a string of amazing performances this season. His averages of 21 ppg and 10.6 rpg are impressive enough, but when you consider that he barely played against ND's early season opponents and is only averaging 28.9 mpg.. then his numbers are that much more impressive. For a quick example, Donte Greene averages 17 ppg, but in 35 mpg.. good for .48 points per minute. Harangody averages .726 points per minutes.. meaning Harangody is 50% more productive.
B - ButlerB - Butler
Congrats to Butler for locking up another Horizon League title. Except for a rough stretch in 04 & 05, the Bulldogs always hover around the 20 win mark and always contend for a conference title. Making it more fun is that they manage to do it despite a revolving door of coaches. Yet, its not the coaches, but the senior class (Graves, Betko, Campbell & Green who joined as a transfer) which deserves all the love. In 2005, Butler's final RPI was 241.. in 2006 it was 82.. in 2007 it was 27.. and right now they have an RPI of 18. That's progression.
C - Wake ForestC - Wake Forest
The Deacs had a golden chance to make a claim for a tournament bid.. hosting Maryland, a fellow ACC bubble squad. Had Wake won, they would have had equal overall wins, equal ACC wins, equal Top 50 wins, and a better RPI than the Terps. And with a 14-1 home record, you figure the game was there's to lose. And lose they did, as Wake trailed just about the entire game after scoring the first basket. Wake is now a Tournament afterthought, especially considering they have two road games coming up, where they're just 1-8 on the season.
D- Michigan State
Maybe my expectations for this team were too high to start the season, but the Spartans season can be described as.. eh. There was the early win over Texas at home, but otherwise they've been so so. 2-5 in Big Ten road games is brutal.. especially considering that one of those wins was against Northwestern and the other a close win over Minnesota. I don't want to bash Izzo and the program too hard.. they're still 22-6 and still going to be a 5 seed, but I thought this group had a chance to be special.
I think it would be sickening to be an Arizona fan. I mean how many teams that are considered NCAA Tournament locks have lost 3 of 4 home games.. let alone to non-Top 25 teams like USC and Arizona State. The Wildcats resume is based on three things: a) They've owned Washington State, b) They fattened up on overrated 2nd tier teams with inflated RPI's (UNLV, SDSU, Houston), and c) they played Memphis & Kansas (losing to both), which boosts their SOS. Because of this, Arizona still has an RPI of 21. Two years ago, Missouri State was denied a bid despite having an RPI of 21. Yet its hard to imagine that happening now because one is from the Pac-10 and the other the MVC..

Alitalia is Italy’s flag carrier, and has its headquarters in Rome. It maintains hubs at both Rome’s Leonardo da Vinci Fiumicino International Airport and Milan’s Malpensa International Airport, the two busiest airpors in the country. Its full name is Alitalia – Linee Aeree Italiane, and the name Alitalia is a play on the Italian word for wings (“ali”) and the name of the country (“Italia”).
Alitalia flies to more than 100 destinations in Africa, Asia, North America, South America and Europe.
The airline has been in financial difficulty for several years (including a period of time when it said it couldn’t pay its workers’ salaries), at one point considering a merger with Air France and KLM (which own 2% of the airline) and more recently getting assistance from the Italian government (which owns 49% of the airline) to help privatize the airline. As of January 2007, Alitalia was looking for a buyer to purchase just over 30% of its shares.
In addition to its financial woes, Alitalia recently had a pretty bad record of losing its passengers’ luggage.
Alitalia is a member of the SkyTeam airline alliance.

452,"Buying your first home – Step 7: the Home Inspection
You have your first home under contract and you are in the option period, it is now time to get the home inspected. Even though you have 7 to 10 days depending upon the length of your Option Period to get your Spring Texas home inspected, you want to schedule them as soon as possible. Scheduling the home inspections as soon as possible will give you time to coordinate the home inspectors schedule with yours, review the inspection report, if necessary get quotes for repairs, and negotiate repairs with the sellers all before the Option Period ends.
How do you choose a home inspector? – Your buyer’s agent should be able to recommend several home inspectors. Contact a couple of the home inspectors and ask a few questions.
Ask them how much they charge for the home inspection, how many homes have they inspected, what does their inspection cover, do they physically get up on the roof and inspect it, how soon will they provide you with the inspection report, and do they take photos of any problems they have identified.
How much does a home inspection cost? – A mechanical and structural home inspection costs around $350 – $500. A termite inspection costs around a $100. There is no set fee for a home inspection
Types of home inspections – There are two types of inspections I recommend buyers have performed on homes they are considering buying. The inspections are a Mechanical and Structural inspection and a Termite inspection. The findings of the Mechanical and Structural inspection may require additional inspections to be performed by licensed service providers. These additional inspections may be to further evaluate the roof, plumbing, electrical or heating and air conditioning systems.
What do the home inspections cover? – A licensed home inspector is required to perform an inspection in accordance with the Standards of Practice mandated by the Texas Real Estate Commission. The Standards of Practice are minimum standards which cover the foundation, grading, roof, walls, ceilings, floors, windows, doors, stairways, porches, fireplace & chimney, roof, electrical, plumbing, heating and air conditioning, and built-in appliances.
The termite inspection will identify any conditions that are conducive to termite activity and any active termite activity.
How long does the inspection take and should you attend the inspection? – the Mechanical and Structural inspection will typically take 2 to 3 hours to be performed. The Termite inspection usually takes 30 minutes and can be performed during the same time frame as the Mechanical and Structural inspection.
You do not need to be present during the entire 2 to 3 hours that it will take to have the home inspected. Although I do recommend you arrive for the last 30 minutes of the inspection so the inspector can summarize his findings and you can ask clarifying questions.
Your home inspector should provide you with a written inspection report usually within 2 to 3 days of the date the inspection was performed.
What do you ask the sellers to repair? – it is unrealistic to ask the sellers to repair every item marked as in need of repair on the home inspection report. Why? Because the home inspector has to identify any item that does not meet building codes irregardless of whether the code was present at the time the house was built. And I have not met a homeowner turned seller yet who has brought his Spring Texas home up to meet the current year’s building codes. It is just not economically feasible.
So if you don’t ask for everything to be repaired what should you focus on? As a home buyer you need to be concerned with items in need of repair that affect the health and safety of your family. For instance if the hand rail on a stairway is loose, you may want to request the seller to repair it because the instability of the hand rail could cause someone in your family to fall. I said you may want to request the seller to repair because you might be a handy person and can handle the repair yourself.
By reviewing the items identified as in need of repair with your home inspector, you will be able to distinguish between the minor items you can handle yourself and the major items you need to request the seller to repair.
Not all inspections have a happy ending with sellers and buyers coming to terms on repairs. Sometimes home buyers repair requests are unrealistic and sometimes home sellers think their home does not need any repairs. As a home buyer, first time or otherwise, you need to establish a walk away position on repairs. Just remember no home is perfect. The Spring Texas home you have under contract is not perfect and if you walk away the next home you find will not be perfect either.

A long-term study of children born into lesbian families that discovered they grow up to be psychologically well-adjusted teenagers has been published in the journal Pediatrics. You can download the study from this site. The study was funded by various queer rights advocacy groups, which of course has led to criticism from some quarters. It’s worth remembering that many studies – including medical studies – are paid for by institutions that have a vested interest in the results. But this does not automatically mean that the results are biased.
There are many stages involved in bringing a new product to the market. First, someone must have an idea for a product. Then someone must design that product. The product must then be presented to someone – usually a committee of people – who decide whether or not the product is worth producing. At some point, a prototype of the product must be produced. After the product has been produced by a company, it then needs to be marketed to further companies who will sell it. So a person, or people from the first company who produced the item must present the product to a buyer or buyers from a second company who decides whether or not to stock that product. Eventually, the product must be sold to members of the public. As you can see, there are a lot of different people involved in designing, producing, and selling some item.

The second section features works from the late 1990s where the ferninist viewpoint, which could be glimpsed in the earlier work, is strongly apparent. The last section is devoted to the artist's current practice and features hitherto unseen pieces deting her preoccupation with the concept of barriers and the use that has been made of them by various cultures w and in the past.

1129,"Identify your audience
Before you even start typing take a moment to think about who will be reading your article. Are you writing for a children’s, or adult’s magazine? Are they industry professionals, or complete beginners in their field? The way in which your article is written is dictated by these answers, so consider it carefully.
If you’re writing for beginners then you’ll need to cover the basics and guide them through the process step-by-step, with screenshots where applicable.
Professionals or more advanced users should already understand the fundamentals, so you can skip them or cover them briefly if it’s relevant. Just remember not to patronise your readers.
The audience will also dictate the length of your writing – children have a much shorter attention span! Regardless of who you’re writing for though, remember to be concise. Don’t bulk out an article for the sake of making it longer. A short, concise article will be more popular than a long-winded one. Also remember your sentence length. Several sentences which have the same number of words can make a piece extremely difficult to read.
Existing magazines are one of your greatest assets when determining your writing style and article length. Go out there and read some.
“No matter how busy you may think you are, you must find time for reading, or surrender yourself to self-chosen ignorance.” Confucius
Choose a topic, but make it unique!
Nobody wants to see 10 articles, by 10 different authors, in 10 different magazines, all covering the same subject in exactly the same way. Find a new topic to make yours unique! If you simply can’t think of something new, approach the topic in a way which makes it new – go into more detail about a particular aspect of it, or show a different way of achieving the same result. Whatever you do, cover it in a way which will aid people’s understanding, rather than just regurgitating the same information.
Research if you need to
Possibly the biggest crime you can commit when writing for a magazine is arrogance. Don’t assume you know everything. The last thing you want to do is claim something and then have your readers refute it. It’s better to double check now. Not all articles will require it, but for some you may wish to cite your sources – especially if you’re making a particularly outrageous claim. If you can back it up with reputable sources, it’ll carry more weight.
“Research is to see what everybody else has seen, and to think what nobody else has thought.” Albert Szent-Györgyi
Conducting an interview
Preparation is key when performing an interview, even if it’s online. Make a list of your questions and keep them open-ended (no “yes” or “no” questions). If you find that your interviewee is being short with their answers tease more information out of them will follow up questions. These impromptu questions don’t need to be written into your final magazine article, but you can use the new information to lengthen their answers.
There are many techniques to record your interviewee’s responses, but even if you’re using a Dictaphone always take notes as well. Technology can fail, or it might not pick up their voice very well, so it’s always best to have a backup.
Once you’ve collated the interview, read it. Don’t be afraid to reword their answers or your questions slightly to help the article flow better (and surely it goes without saying to correct grammar and spelling errors). Just ensure you’re not changing their opinion on anything.
Check it!
Even if you’re submitting it somewhere that has a proof-reader, check your work yourself. The less work the editor has to do the more credible you’ll be as an article writer. Depending on the voice of the magazine, you may need to take out any abbreviations or symbols (& to “and”), so it’s paramount that you make these changes before submitting.

211,"Power plant enters planning process
The Four Corners region could be facing a hazy future. A massive, new coal-fired power plant planned for the region is undergoing review, and the public is being asked to comment on the proposal.
The $2 billion plant would be the third coal-burning plant in the San Juan Basin. It would be built on the Navajo Nation roughly 20 miles south of Kirtland and has been tagged the Desert Rock Project. It's estimated that the plant would generate enough energy for 1.5 million homes.
""It's a very large plant at 1,500 megawatts,"" said Dan Randolph of San Juan Citizens' Alliance,
A fourth, smaller plant, named the Mustang Project, is also seeking approval to begin construction between Farmington and Grants, N.M. Originally, the plant was expected to be operational by next year, but there have been delays. Mustang has categorically refused to consider alternative and environmentally friendly technologies, yet recently received a $20 million subsidy under President Bush's so-called Clear Skies Initiative.
While these plants are not within La Plata County's viewshed, they are well within its airshed, according to Randolph. Plus, local air quality is already significantly impacted by the two existing power plants in northern New Mexico.
""A good respiratory health study for the basin has not been done at all,"" Randolph said. ""Before we put more smoke up in the air, we should know what the impacts already are.""
The Bureau of Indian Affairs has invited the public to submit written comments through Dec. 17 on the Desert Rock plant. There is also one public hearing planned in the region and it will take place Tuesday, Dec. 7, at the Farmington Civic Center.
""At this point, there is only one public meeting scheduled locally,"" Randolph said. ""We're pushing for an additional meeting in Shiprock.""
Randolph concluded that this scoping period is an opportunity for locals to raise issues they would like to have addressed during the review process. Written comments can be sent through Dec. 17 to: Eloise Chicharello, director, Navajo Regional Office, Bureau of Indian Affairs, P.O. Box 1060, Gallup, N.M., 87305.
Buena Vista voters repeal RGI
One of the poster children for Durango's proposed Responsible Growth Initiative has gone away. On Nov. 2, Buena Vista voters repealed an initiative that required a popular vote for large annexations. It had been in existence for five years and touted as a success story by proponents of Durango's similar measure, which was also rejected by voters Nov. 2.
Buena Vista resident Randy Loback told the Denver Post that easing development restrictions was the only way to keep the town from dying. Loback noted that residents, ""used to be concerned about what's affecting them now. I think a lot of people have turned their thoughts to the long term. What's good for their kids?""
In particular, Buena Vista residents were interested in boosting sales tax revenues by attracting commercial properties. The Post noted that residents have realized that the summer tourism economy is not enough for Buena Vista.
""We have young people graduating who have to move because there's very little here in terms of finding jobs that can pay for you to live,"" said Mayor Sharyle Solis.
Public lands ""passport"" in works
Bikers, hikers and all users of public lands may have to start carrying a ""passport"" when they recreate. An Ohio congressman has successfully pushed a measure through Congress that would require members of the public to purchase an ""America the Beautiful"" pass to recreate on all land managed by the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Reclamation.
Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, succeeded in attaching his bill as a rider to the giant Omnibus Appropriations Bill recently enacted in the lame duck session of Congress. The bill was never passed by the House and was never introduced, given a hearing or voted upon in the Senate. Omnibus bills are considered ""must pass"" legislation because of the potential for a government shutdown.
Regula's bill, HR 3283, allows the federal land management agencies to charge access fees for recreational use of public lands by the general public. The bill has been highly controversial and is opposed by hundreds of organizations, state legislatures, county governments and members of the public.
""This was a victory of pork over principle,"" said Robert Funkhouser, president of the Western Slope No-Fee Coalition. ""Ralph Regula is responsible for the first tax increase of the Bush administration.""
The Regula bill will go into effect when Fee Demo expires at the beginning of fiscal year 2005 unless the new congress acts to derail it. Failure to carry the pass will be a criminal offense punishable by up to $5,000 and/or six months in jail. The America the Beautiful Pass is expected to cost between $85 and $100 annually.
""This is an abuse of position by Congressman Regula"" according to Funkhouser. ""Changing public land policy in the middle of the night via a rider is despicable. Once again the congressman has proven to be hostile to rural and Western values and will stop at nothing to push his agenda.""
Fugitive pot grower nabbed
Members of the Southwest Drug Task Force recently concluded a three-year investigation with the arrest of former La Plata County resident Edward Pole. Pole was arrested on Thursday in Humble, Texas, after evading officers since December 2001. Pole was involved with a ""sophisticated"" marijuana cultivation operation located at the La Plata County home of Lynn Crandall. Crandall and Pole had been charged in U.S. District Court with charges related to conspiracy to manufacture marijuana, conspiracy to distribute marijuana and money laundering.
According to investigators, Pole is believed to have traveled to Canada, Panama and Costa Rica after learning about the December 2001 bust. The task force was able to locate Pole in Texas after he re-entered the United States several months ago.
The Southwest Drug Task Force is a multi-jurisdictional investigative body comprised of the La Plata County Sheriffs Office, Ignacio Police Department and the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. The Southwest Drug Task Force routinely files criminal cases in both Colorado State Court and the U.S. Federal Court System.

1639,"Author's Note: I believe that activities in the mathematics classroom should be as varied as possible. Not all students are passive learners - for example kinesthetic learners need to move around and touch things to learn. Not all my lessons cater for all types of learners, but I do like to vary the style of teaching to ensure that students experience methods that suit them some of the time. I consider the activity that follows well worth the effort of having students move around and organize themselves to take measurements. The fact that it also involves history of mathematics is a big bonus.
Figure 1. Sixteen men leaving a church service measure their rood, as illustrated in the geometry book of Jacob Köbel (1460-1533), 1608 edition.
The word ""rood"" can be traced back to the Germanic ""rute"" and from there to the Old English rod. We know a rood today as a large crucifix often found beside entrances to old churches (for an example see Romsey Abbey (Hampshire, UK)). It is also a measure of land area of about a quarter of an acre or 40 square rods.
However the rood in which we are interested here is a linear unit which ranged from 16.5 to 24 feet in length at various times and in different countries. At 16.5 feet it was identical to the surveyor's rod. In a book on surveying by Jacob Köbel (1460-1533), he mentions that the surveyor should request that on leaving the church service 16 men should stop as they come out and stand in a line with their left feet touching the others, heel to toe. Then the length of the 16 feet gives the ""right and lawful"" rood. Dividing by 16 then gives an average foot. (Why 16? Perhaps this gives sufficient people to produce a valid sample and still makes division easy since 16 is a power of two and so four successive halvings gives the mean foot.) This method of random selection was used with my Year 7 class at the Mountbatten School, Romsey, UK as they left my lesson, repeated with our school staff (with their right feet) as they left a morning briefing, and then reiterated with some of the attendees at the Symposium X van de Historische Kring voor Reken Wiskunde Onderwijs (The historical group for arithmetic and mathematical education) in The Netherlands.
Figure 2. The teachers at The Mountbatten School, Romsey measure their rood.
The respective results were 4.14m, 4.40m and 4.68m, all well short of today's rod (5.03m) but longer than the old German rute (3.8m). Further data was obtained at the History and Pedagogy of Mathematics Conference held in Uppsala, Sweden during July, 2004. Here 16 mixed adults gave a result of 4.58 m and 16 males yielded 4.85m. This generated much discussion. Does this indicate that foot length has reduced over the last 5 centuries? (Perhaps manual labour in the fields leads to bigger hands and feet.) Has shoe length reduced? (The illustration shows the men wearing shoes, but these seem similar in shape to today's footwear.) How much does age matter? In future years we will do this experiment with different year groups and measure the sexes separately. We will then be able to use the data to compare the groups, an excellent opportunity for statistical coursework.
Opportunities for using history of mathematics and real data in the classroom do not come often. By involving pupils and using their data they feel ownership of the data and are eager to see how they measure up to other groups. Readers who send me their results (pransom@btinternet.com) will receive a complete set of the data sent to me in due course. Please let me know the age, sex (female, male, mixed) and geographical location of the data sent. If enough data is received, there may be scope for a wide range of statistical investigation. With a large enough data base, means and standard deviations can be found and ages and/or sex can be compared.","What is the historical method of measuring a ""rood"" as described by Jacob Köbel?","The historical method of measuring a ""rood"" as described by Jacob Köbel involves having 16 men stand in a line with their left feet touching the others, heel to toe, upon leaving a church service.

2082,"Contrary to what many people believe, disability is not a concern that is limited to the elderly. The reality is that you could suffer a temporary, or permanent, disability at any time during the course of your lifetime – though the odds do increase with age. Fortunately, the United States government has programs that offer financial assistance to individuals who are disabled. Both the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program provide monetary assistance to disabled individuals who qualify. Though the programs are similar, they have different eligibility guidelines and often provide very different benefits. To help ensure that you receive all the benefits to which you may be entitled, the Indianapolis elder law attorneys at Frank & Kraft explain the differences and similarities between SSI and SSDI.
Are You Disabled?
The first hurdle you must get past if you wish to qualify for either (or both) SSI or SSDI is to
Supplemental Security Income (SSI)
If you meet the SSA definition of “disabled,” the only other eligibility requirement for the SSI program is that you have income and resources that fall below the program limits. The resources limit for an individual is $2,000 and for a married couple $3,000 in most states. Unlike the SSDI program, an applicant is not required to have a work history to qualify for SSI; however, the monthly benefits for SSI recipients are typically less than for SSDI recipients as well. In 2018, for example, the maximum SSI benefit, referred to as the “Federal Benefit Rate (FBR),” is $750 per month for individuals and $1,125 for couples. The FBR increases annually if there is a Social Security cost-of-living adjustment. In addition, some states provide a state supplement, ranging from $10 to $200, which is added to the federal SSI benefit payment.
Another difference between SSI and SSDI is that family members cannot benefit from an applicant’s eligibility for SSI benefits. You may, however, be automatically eligible for other government assistance programs, such as Medicaid or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), once you are approved for SSI benefits.
Social Security Disability Income SSDI
Qualifying for the SSDI program is more difficult; however, the benefits are typically better if you do get approved. To qualify for SSDI you must have a sufficient work history prior to becoming disabled. Working earns you “work credits” that you need to qualify for SSDI. The number of “work credits” you need will depend on your age at the time of application; however, most applicants need to have earned 20 credits during the preceding 10 years. A work credit is earned by earning a designated amount ($1,320 for the year 2018) up to a maximum of four credits a year if you earned $5,280 or more. Because SSDI benefits are based on your work history, the monthly benefit you receive will almost always be higher than the current SSI benefit. By way of example, the average monthly SSDI benefit for 2018 is $1,197 with a maximum benefit of $2,788. Another important benefit to qualifying for SSDI is that if you are found to be eligible, your dependents may also qualify for monthly benefits based on your work record.
Note: It is possible to receive both SSDI and SSI if your SSDI benefit is small enough that you meet the income limit for the SSI program.
How to Apply for SSI or SSDI
You can apply for both SSDI and SSI online through the Social Security Administration’s website. Unfortunately, about two out of every three initial applications for SSDI are denied which is why it is usually in your best interest to consult with an experienced elder law attorney if you feel you might be entitled to SSI or SSDI benefits before completing the application.

436,"With the release of Xcode 4.4 I've taken a look back at our existing code standards and tried to come up with something that is cleaner and more elegant. Here are a few of the ideas I've been using to modernize the codebase.
Remove private method declarations and use class extensions to add ivars.
First to get chopped by the deletion button are private method declarations. After Xcode 4.2 came out we took to using the class extension feature to add private method declarations at the top of implementation files. This was a nice way of keeping private methods out of the header files. Now that the compiler will check for pre-existing method signatures within the same object there's no need to define their interfaces.
Occasionally it's necessary for subclass to know about private methods defined by its superclass, so we use a shared category to let them know what they respond to. Like Apple, we also quit using
@private in header files.
Ivars now should go in class extensions, and be prefixed by an underscore. Apple advises that you don't use method names with underscores but encourage underscored variable names. This also can free up method parameters from having ugly names such as anArtwork or aString.
Use object literals when possible.
Object literals are ways of adding syntacitcal sugar to the Objective-C language, they let you access keys and values easily on
NSDictionarys and objects in
NSArrays. There's no reason to not be using them if you're supporting iOS 4 and above. It's simple a matter of
_artworks[2] vs
[_artworks objectAtIndex:2].
Dot syntax is OK for non-properties.
OK so, I admit it. I whined when properties came out. It was back in 2007 and the Objective-C was ranked 40th in the world, it's now ranked 3nd most popular programming language. Within timeframe, my opinion on the subject of properties changed also.
Originally when properties came out they exclusively were given the right to use dot notation on objects. This makes sense as they were created to provide public access to ivars which normally you can only access internally using the dot notation. With Xcode 4.3, that also changed. Now, if a method doesn't have any arguments it can be called using dot notation. I'm in favour of using this. For me a good rule of thumb has been if a method returns something, dot notation is OK. For example,
_artworksArray.count is fine whilst
_parsingOperation.stop isn't.
Keep external code out of your project.
External, or vendored code should be kept out of the main body of your code. You can use CocoaPods to keep all that code in check and up-to-date. CocoaPods is a project that aims to be what bundler does for ruby projects, or npm for node. It will deal with your dependancies whilst you can concentrate on your own code. It will create a seperate Xcode project that handles all you dependancies leaving your project only as your own code.
Use umbrella imports.
To try and keep the amount of noise we have at the top of our implementation files we have started to reduce the number of
#import ""ARModel.h"" lines we use. By creating a
Models.h file and having that include all the models it means we can still have a look through the
#imports at the top to get an idea of the connections between the objects as that will only show the important imports. These can optionally be moved into your precompiled header files.
Keep your code clean.
Whitespace can and does slowly accumulate at the line-endings of your code. You should make sure that the new preference for automatically trimming whitespace is turned on in the text editing section of Xcode's preferences.
IBOutlets should probably go in your class extensions.
With modern versions of Xcode, it doesn't matter that your IBOutlets are defined in places other than in headers. As Objective-C developers, we've come a long way from having to repeatedly drag a .h from Xcode to Interface Builder, so maybe it's time to rethink the idea that our interface outlets should be publicly accessible. My opinion is that a controller's views are for the most part a private affair and that if you want to expose their functionality you do it through custom methods in the controller. There are some downsides to this, in that initially you have to change to the implementation file when using hybrid view when connecting them.
These decisions have come from internal discussions and from watching many WWDC sessions on the topic. We highly recommend watching the following WWDC sessions.
WWDC 2011: 105 Polishing Your App, 112 Writing Easy To Change Code and 322 - Objective-C Advancements in Depth.

STEUBENVILLE, O., May 31.
Special Dispatch to the Intelligencer.
It is now certain that the much talked of and much postponed Goss and Ryan fight will take place to- morrow morning, at or near Collier's Station, West Virginia. There is some little excitement in the city to-night, owing to the presence of New York and Pittsburgh roughs. T. J. H.
On the Spot.
COLLIERS', W. VA., May 31
Special Dispatch to the Intelligencer.
Your reporter arrived at this out of the way place this afternoon, and later in the evening found Paddy Ryan and his trainer, Johnny Roach, quartered here. Their party numbers only four.
Joe Goss and party are at the house of a farmer named Snyder, two miles below this point.
The ground for the fight has been selected, and is situated within one hundred rods of the Pennsylvania State line, and one mile and a half from the Station.
The ropes, stakes and all the paraphernalia of the prize ring are ready for use, and everything looks like business and no fooling, this time.
Ryan is in fine condition and is confident of winning the fight. Goss is reported well, and ready and anxious for the battle.
The fight will come off as soon after daylight as possible, to-morrow.
There is a very small crowd, present here, and everything is quiet up to the hour of writing.
They are Notified that They Cannot Fight on Pennsylvania Soil.
They are Notified that They Cannot Fight on Pennsylvania Soil.
PITTSBURGH, May 31. There seems but little doubt that a first-class prize fight will take place near this city within the next 12 or 24 hours. The city is filling with sporting men, who are attracted by the positive knowledge that Joe Goss and Paddy Ryan are in town, and that they will fight before to- morrow's sunset. Those in the best position to give particulars concerning this event are extremely reticent, particularly when questioned by newspaper men. Very few of the fraternity are certain when and where this mill will take place, but a general canvass fixes the time to-morrow morning, and the place as Collier's Station, on the Panhandle road, and within a short distance of the State line between this State and West Virginia.
The presence here of the principals in the coming fight increases the prevailing interest. Paddy Ryan has for some time been in training at Fairchild's, five miles out the Perrysville road, and has been actively preparing for to-morrow's event. Ryan is 28 years of age and six foot one inches in height, weight 160 pounds. He has never fought in the prize ring. His trainer is Johnny Roach. Joe Goss, who has been in training at Port Hamilton, N. Y., reached this city this morning from the East, via Cincinnati Express on the Pennsylvania railroad, at 8:11. He was accompanied by his trainer and by Billy Tracey, his backer. The men attracted a good deal of attention.
Goss was neatly dressed in dark clothes. He is an Englishman by birth, is forty-four years old, and stands five feet eight inches in height and his fighting weight is placed at 150 pounds. He entered the prize ring in 1859, and has taken part in many famous battles. It is claimed that he has deteriorated in condition and is scarcely a match for Ryan. After Goss had walked the length of the Union Depot he was hurried into a carriage that stood in waiting and was driven out of the eager crowd. A continuance of the present, delightful weather will tend to increase the assured big attendance at this mill.
In regard to the proposed fight Chief of Police Pender says that he is determined it shall not take place in this county, and he will use every means in his power to this end. He has had an eye on the principals all day, but has been unable to hear anything definite concerning their plans. Of course, if the battle takes place outside of Allegheny county, as in all probability it will, it will be impossible for him to interfere, and none of the parties can bee arrested until they have actually violated the law.
This afternoon it was learned that Joe Goss quarters at or near McKee's Rocks. The pugilist was sent for by Mayor In(?)dell, and was told that he must fight outside of Allegheny county. The pugilist and his friends assured the Mayor that the trouble would take place outside. Arthur Chambers, one of the party, stated that the fight would take place outside the State.

485,"Hey beauties,
For the last year, I have been going to Danish classes about 4 times a week. Most of the time I resented it and couldn’t be happier for the day I’d be done with language school. But now I’m almost done and I feel like I’m not ready to be “released” into Danish society just yet.
In Denmark there are 3 language levels (for those that only went to elementary school, high school, or have an academic background) and I’m placed in the group with an academic background where the full education will lead up to level B2. So for most of last year, I have been in different classes with like-minded people and a lot of them I call my friends.
While I was allowed to skip the first module pretty much on the basis of speaking Dutch, it still took me a year to finish module 2 til 5 (which I considering long, but it’s actually a lot shorter than the 3 years the government reserves for us). I never allowed myself to take any breaks, not even during summer. My dad learned Dutch in about 2/3 years and my mom, well lets just say that she “knows” Dutch and they did this all under the pressure of a 60 hour a week job. So I was (and still am) determined to get a hold on this language.
Most of the time though, I didn’t really felt that my Danish was improving at all and in my mind I always made the next module the benchmark of being fluent: while being in module 3, I’d say “when I’m in module 4, I’ll be fluent” and while being in module 4, I’d say the same about module 5. I’d always feel intimidated by those darn Germans, because somehow they were always fluent as soon as they just walked into the class room. And over the year, I’ve received a lot of feedback (or critique) from my teachers on my writing assignment. But honestly, who wants to write a 200 words essay about the Danish healthcare system?
So now I’ve finished the first half of the final exam (level B2) and I just received the below messaged from the language school:
First of all, I have to start with the Danish grading scale, it might be the weirdest system world-wide. The lowest grade is a -3, passing is 02 and 12 is the highest grade. While I was kinda aiming for “passing”, so it all would be done, I surprised myself with a 12 (A or 10/10) for reading and a 10 for writing (B or 9/10). While I received these fantastic grades, I still feel my Danish isn’t wat it is supposed to be. Of course, at this point I’m able to go see a doctor in Danish, order a beer at the bar or even do some small talking. But I definitely feel that I’m not completely able yet to let my personality shine through in Danish and I easily get caught of guard when people speak Danish to me. In 2 weeks I will have my (final) oral exam and if I pass this I will finally done: but do I really want to be done?
I’m really hard for myself and while most people are satisfied with the regular “Danskuddannelse”, I’m still not content with my Danish these days. If I manage to graduate with a 10 on average, it’s possible to apply for “Studieprøve”: a Danish education, which leads to level C1. With this diploma you’re allowed to study at a Danish taught education (not that I’m interested in that), but it gives me some more time to develop my Danish skill further. So even though, I have shouted for the last year that I wanted Danish to be over I have to withdraw my words.
Have you ever tried to learn a new language and has it been as frustrating as Danish has been for me?
With love,
-Janet

het klinkt heel lastig, goed dat je toch gewoon doorgaat! de aanhouder wint zullen we maar zeggen :)!
Dankje babe! En het einde is gelukkig in zicht 😀
hi! i’m just a randomer passing by, but you really sound like you’re very hard on yourself. i’m studying to be a sign language interpreter, and while i’m in my fourth year of uni i still don’t feel entirely comfortable and fluent in sign language (which was an entirely new language to me). i have to practise every day or i lose it, and i have to repeat lots. learning a new language isn’t easy (as you clearly know), and i think you can give yourself some credit for doing well, and be a little kinder to yourself. i’d say, don’t compare yourself to anyone else and take it at your own pace, seems like you’re working hard enough. i’m sure you’ll get there and good luck!
Hi Sabienne,
Thank you for your sweet and encouraging comment! I know I should be more chilled about this new language and trust that, with time, it all will come. But it’s hard (as you might know) to stay positive, when you’re frustrated when things don’t run smoothly. I think it’s amazing that you’re studying sigh language and can’t even imagine how hard that must be. Good luck with your journey!
PS: I loved your comment about not comparing myself with others, sometimes I forget that at the end of the day we all are different. Some do learn a new language within a sneeze and me, well apparently I need some time.. But it’s okay, at least I can bake a killer apple pie..

1084,"''Wiggle your magic fingers,'' said Mr. Paul, comedy magician at the Girard Free Library last month.
On command, the room filled with 6- to 12 year-olds raised their hands and wiggled their fingers to make the magic happen.
With the help of the children's ''magic fingers,'' Mr. Paul made multi-colored sponge balls disappear, commanded a rubber duck to tell the future and encouraged children to read their favorite books as part of the library's summer reading program, ''Make a Splash - Read.''
Elizabeth Carpenter, 8, of Cortland, makes magic happen with comedy magician Mr. Paul at the Girard Free Library June 30. Mr. Paul was at the library as part of the ‘‘Make a Splash’’ summer reading program.
RIGHT:?Caleb Maurice, 10, of Girard, impersonates a duck as magician Mr. Paul entertains children at the library. The summer reading program encompasses children, teens and adults to encourage reading and fun at the library through July.
Incorporating books and reading, the magician advised children, ''between F for fiction and N for non-fiction, is U and that spells FUN.''
Reading is fun, he told the group who sat diligently on the floor, laughing at his jokes and missteps and quickly raising their hands in hopes of being called to the front as a participant in the show.
The summer reading program is one of the many services still provided by the library, which has had to cut some programs due to funding cuts that forced area libraries to tighten their budgets.
''This program is sponsored by the Friends of the Library,'' said library director Rose Ann Lubert. ''If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't be able to do this,'' she said.
One of the programs cut for the summer was the children's storytimes, which included separate activities and storytelling for children of all ages and adults.
Storytimes are expected to resume the week after Labor Day beginning Sept. 13.
The Friends of the Girard Free Library sponsor many fundraising activities. Annual dues are $5 individual; $10 family; individual lifetime, $100; club, business or association, $25 and individual patron, $25. Printable membership forms are available online at or at the library, located at 105 E. Prospect St.
Library hours are 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Wednesday; 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Thursday; 9 a.m. to 4 p .m. Friday; and 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday.

Cirrus
Casino offers the most prominent casino games
including Blackjack, Baccarat, Caribbean Stud,
Video Poker, Roulette, Slots and more. The software
and infrastructure developed is the most technologically
advanced in the world!
It is cirrus' stated
mission to provide you with exclusive entertainment
and the best odds in the business. The payouts
on all the games are designed to be comparable
to the top casinos in Las Vegas and conform
to the strictest Nevada gaming rules. You can
play for fun (as long as you wish) or with real
money. They are fully licensed as well.
There are several
reasons why we chose Cirrus Casino over the
rest. First, they have some of the best bonuses
and manager offers around. Second, they use
real-time gaming (RTG) software --which will
be releasing a new version soon that will include
an ultra-enhanced version of Slots for those
die-hard slots players out there. Third, their
support is excellent. And finally, they are
right around the corner from us in Costa Rica.
So, we can always
get in touch with them easily or go through
their marketing firm which is just down the
street from us also. All of these things together
make Cirrus our # 1 pick.
Personally, I was
intimidated at first to play ""Craps"",
but ultimately I found this to be my best game.
I usually start out with $300 and play from
there, and I typically get to play for hours
and hours whether I lose or else choose to cash
out when I have tripled my money.
I do really well with this one.
I'm not the only
successful one either. In our first month of
promoting Cirrus Casino, we checked our stats
and one depositing player (real cash) made and
withdrew over $6,000 --and she was playing Keno!
I have no idea how anyone can win at that game,
but she really racked up on it. Then, just a
couple of weeks later, we saw a guy deposit
and win nearly $2,000 playing BlackJack. Of
course, there are those that lose occasionally
too, but it wouldn't be ""gambling""
if they didn't! hah
I definately pick
""Craps"" as my new favorite gambling
game, and I also like playing Blackjack and
Pai Gow Poker. My wife seems to be invincible
at ""War"", but I've never acquired
a knack for that card game. ;)

2282,"Kandy with its Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic at Sri Lanka
3h30 trip standing up but we made only the first 1h30, then, when people started to get off, seats starting to be free.
If you are looking to a bathroom, in the train, there are some but I will say, use it only if really really you can't stand. The other solution, before to get in the train, in the station, there are bathroom for foreigners, normally it is closed so you have to ask the key to the employees by going directly to their office.
To find the toilet, once you are inside the station, go left, you will pass in front of the offices and just after them, you should spot the sign, you can't miss it because it is clearly written ""foreigner toilet"".
We arrived at Kandy (last stop) at 21h10 so now, we had to go to our hotel Kandy Supreme Hotel (63, rajapihilla mawatha - 45 euros per night). According to Google Map, it is just 16 minutes walking but it doesn't say that it is up to a hill and half of the section has no light.
We took a tuk-tuk sent by the hotel for 300 rupees (1,90 euros). The room is clean with a great view on the city and on the big Buddha but I won't recommend to people who need to sleep. We didn't need to put an alarm because, next to it, there is a college so very noisy starting at 6h30am and at 7h30 they start to sing before to study and our room has a slim translucent curtain that let the day light coming in. The funny thing is that there is a paper warning about monkeys, because our room has a small terrace and monkeys can come to ""play"" with you.
We visited the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic (temple square) also known as Sri Dalada Maligawa, to get in, the security guy doesn't allow people to go through with a short pant and a sleeveless t-shirt (for children no problem). My wife brought a scarf and I went to buy a local pant for 500 rupees (3,10 euros).
If you need a guide, just at the entrance there are some proposing their service, in our case, we didn't take one.
Once inside, we visited the different free areas, there are small temples that we entered removing our shoes. Once done, we went to the main one, there are a stand to let your shoes, one for local before the security and one for foreigners after the security. After that, we bought our ticket for 1000 rupees each (6,20 euros).
To see the sacred tooth of Buddha protected by a gold casket and to enter to sacred rooms, you have to be at:
- 5h30 and 7h
- 9h30 and 11h
- 17h30 and 19h
To see the gold casket and not the tooth because it is protected inside, you will have to go to the first floor by making the queue and the sacred rooms are downstair. We didn't come between those time tables so we went to see the guy who stamped our ticket and asking him if it was possible to come back at 18h with the same ticket and kindly, he told us no problem.
So we left the temple to go to lunch after taking back our shoes. The guy who keeps them asked money saying ""donation"" showing a box, we gave him 40 rupees (0,30 euros) but it seems that he kept it for himself. Anyway, up to you to give something or not, I saw some few people who didn't give anything.
To lunch, we went to the Kandy Muslim Hotel (sri dalada veediya) and I ordered a beef kotu for 240 rupees (1,50 euros). One of the typical local plates, quite spicy (if you don't like spicy, you can ask without) and quite big.
Now that our stomach was filled, we went quickly to the Kandyan Cultural Centre (72, sangaraja mawatha) to watch a kandyan dance for 1000 rupees each (6,20 euros). There is only 1 session from 17h to 18h. Meanwhile heading to the place, there was a local guy following us and talking to us until the entrance even if we said nothing or we made ugly face, he was still there. To buy our ticket, he told something to the guy in his language but we said to the ticket guy that he is not with us.
The dance session is composed of 11 acts, all dancers and drummers are dressed with traditional costumes and it ends with the walk on fire. This walk represents the virgin walk of Sita, a princess promised to Rama, the seventh avatar of the Hindu God, but she was kidnapped during years by Ravana, the demon king.
Costumes are nice but the show itself is not so good. If you want to see it, follow the lake and you will spot it on your left, it is very near to the sacred tooth temple.
There is no way to miss the Kandy Lake since it is situated near to both sites. In the town, there is a big supermarket at the main street (sri dalada veediya) where we bought an umbrella (because it was raining), water and food. In fact, in this street, we found a lot of things, shops, market, places to eat including KFC, etc.
Contrary to Colombo, there are no meter tuk-tuks so each time we took one, we asked first the price before to get in. If we were not pleased, we negotiated it until agreement or not. Time to leave the city of Kandy to Nuwara Eliya with its Lovers Leap waterfall.
Your comment (temporarily unavailable)",What are the specific times to see the sacred tooth of Buddha protected by a gold casket at the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic?,"The specific times to see the sacred tooth of Buddha protected by a gold casket at the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic are 5h30 and 7h, 9h30 and 11h, and 17h30 and 19h."
1614,"As we age, the wear and tear of everyday life results in damage to our DNA. Research shows that we are able to slow down and reduce this damage by increasing specific nutrients.
The challenge
We are all getting old
We are all aware of the wear and tear daily life has on our body, what we might not be so aware of is that some wear and tear also impacts our body's DNA, which is the blueprint of our life. As we age, the quality of our DNA declines, increasing the risk of some diseases.
DNA damage is the most fundamental cause of developmental and degenerative disease and accelerated ageing.
Our response
You are what you eat
What we eat, how much we exercise, lifestyle habits and our environment all have an influence on how much DNA damage occurs. Pioneering CSIRO research has demonstrated that damage to the bodies DNA is a fundamental disease that can be diagnosed and partially reversed.
A team of CSIRO scientists identified nine micronutrients that are significantly associated with DNA damage. The group also showed that supplementation with certain micronutrients can reduce DNA damage.
Through work lead by Dr Michael Fenech, CSIRO has developed a technique for measuring DNA damage which has placed us at the forefront of research and development of diagnostics.
The results
Damage control
Based on this research, Dr Fenech proposed a novel diseases prevention strategy based on the diagnosis and nutritional treatment of genome damage. This led to the development of Reach100 , a medical clinic offering diagnostic blood tests that measure DNA damage and information relating to the nutritional, life-style and environmental factors that influence it.
The team at Reach100 checks the levels of important micronutrients in the patient's blood, including red cell folate, serum folate and Vitamin B12, which are all essential for the body’s ability to replicate healthy DNA. Reach100 doctors then make recommendations about the health of the patients DNA, based on the results of these tests.

341,"OTTAWA—Canada plans to take steps to “strengthen” its cyber-warfare arsenal, according to documents released by the Department of National Defence.
The documents are a rare public admission from National Defence that it is developing offensive cyber-weapons in addition to tools to defend against such attacks.
“Cyber ... (is) increasingly prominent among the security and defence challenges facing Canada and its allies,” read the documents, posted to the department’s website.
“(In 2017) we will advance our research in the future of cyber warfare to improve and strengthen both our defensive and offensive capabilities.”
There is some debate over what actually constitutes a “cyber-weapon” or an act of “cyber-war.” The most commonly cited example is a virus dubbed Stuxnet, widely attributed to the United States, which in 2010 sabotaged Iran’s nuclear program before spreading to the wider Internet.
More recently, Russia was accused of launching a cyberattack against Ukraine’s power grid in 2015, causing a blackout in the capital city of Kyiv.
When it comes to cyber-warfare, the Canadian government typically likes to talk about defence more than offensive capabilities. But that appears to be changing, with former members of Canada’s defence and intelligence agencies openly musing about future cyber-war.
In an interview with Postmedia earlier this month, Brig.-Gen Paul Rutherford said Canada will be sending “cyber-warriors” to Latvia this June to protect that country’s networks from Russian cyberattacks.
“First and foremost, we recognize cyber as a domain of warfare … We are constantly under attack,” Rutherford told Postmedia.
“We want to bring people into the trade to become what I call cyber-warriors.”
The documents posted by the department state the Canadian Forces will create a new military occupation called “Cyber Operators” to bring in employees with the skills required to conduct complex cyberattacks and defence.
“It’s maybe about time,” said Alex Wilner, a professor of international affairs at Carleton University.
“I think implicitly what (National Defence) is saying here is that in Canada we see the cyber-domain as a military domain. That’s the way the Americans see it, that’s the way the Russians see it.”
Other academics studying these issues stress that caution is needed before Canada fully embraces cyber-warfare — and note the challenges in even defining what “cyber-war” is.
“Cyber-war is challenging all of our previously held notions of warfare,” said Stephanie Carvin, a former intelligence analyst who also teaches at Carleton. “Who is and isn’t a combatant? What is an armed attack?”
The department raised the question of cyber-warfare in their sweeping Defence Review project, the results of which are expected later this year.
Wesley Wark, a professor focusing on security and intelligence issues at the University of Ottawa, said he read the documents as a go-slow approach on these issues
“Clearly there is a feeling that this is a future for Canadian military operations that the (Canadian Forces) is going to have to prepare for,” Wark said in an email. “But best that it do so openly rather than in the shadows.”
Wark told the Star in September that escalation and proliferation of cyber-weapons was also a concern — a point that even John Adams, the former head of the Communications Security Establishment who has pushed for the Canadian government to prepare for cyberwarfare, conceded at the time.
Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan was travelling Thursday, and was not available for an interview. In a statement, his spokesperson said any use of cyber-weapons would be “approved by the government on a mission-by-mission basis,” and would adhere to domestic and international law.
In a statement, the Department of National Defence called developing a cyber-component a “key priority” for the Canadian Forces.
“As cyberspace evolves and expands, it is critical that we look to the future and determine the optimal approaches to strengthen our ability to defend mission-critical military systems, building the future cyber force, and integrating cyber operations into broader military operations,” wrote DND spokesperson Daniel LeBouthillier.",What steps is Canada planning to take in the realm of cyber-warfare according to the Department of National Defence documents?,"Canada plans to strengthen its cyber-warfare arsenal, developing offensive cyber-weapons in addition to tools to defend against such attacks.

1641,"Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini once famously said: ""Economics is for donkeys."" Well, looking at the economy of Iran today it is clear that Iran could do with some more donkeys, in the guise of economists. Iran has perhaps the largest combined oil and gas resources in the world. It has about 980 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and about 132 billion barrels of oil. One cannot say that Iran is a resource-poor country, but it is a resource policy-poor country. The increasingly ""conservative"" yet risk-taking leadership is driving Iran's economy into the mud.
A major reason behind this is the huge subsidization for gasoline, diesel fuel, and electricity. Energy subsidies may represent as much as 15-20 percent of GDP, or about $35-40 billion per year. Iran also imports one-third of its gasoline needs to the tune of about $4-5 billion per year. The cost of gasoline in Iran is about 40 cents per gallon. This has prompted a huge and increasing demand for gasoline, well beyond what it would be if the price were in tune with the higher cost Iran pays for its gasoline.
The gasoline subsidy is also an indirect subsidy to Iran's automobile industry, which is pumping out 1 million cars a year into the already clogged streets of Tehran, Isfahan, and other cities. The auto industry employs about 500,000 people. So the argument goes that Iran should keep them employed at huge costs to the country's fragile economy.
Each one of those auto jobs likely costs Iran many times the productivity of each of the workers employed. It would make more sense to move auto workers to more competitive industries. But that's not in the cards.
Subsidizing gasoline and the auto industry has lead to vast increases in air pollution and subsequent health problems, especially in Tehran. So we must also factor in the health effects and costs of such subsidies.
Another cost is the ""opportunity cost"" of the money for subsidizing and importing gasoline and subsidizing the non-competitive auto industry.
Those funds could be going toward developing Iran's severely underinvested oil and gas industries. Maybe the donkeys are right.
Iran has part of the largest natural gas field in the world - what Qatar, which shares the field, calls the North Field, and what the Iranians call South Pars. About half of Iranian natural gas can be found there. Most Iranian oil is located in the southwest of the country, and there are very large new oil fields that have been discovered in the last few years, yet that have not been developed. One of the reasons behind this is the imposition of strict constraints on outside investors: Due to very limiting buyback contracts, investors cannot share in the production and management of the oil fields that they develop.
As an example of the misdirection of resources, take the case of the Oil Stabilization Fund. The fund is designed to stabilize the budget by moving funds from high oil price years to low oil price years. However, it is often ransacked to pay for energy subsidies and gasoline imports. Yet by investing some $75 billion - or just over two years of energy subsidies - Iran could vastly increase its oil production to around 6 million barrels a day from its current 3.9 million barrels a day. For about $85 billion - or two and a half years of energy subsidies - it could bring up to speed its liquefied natural gas trains, pipelines, and production capacities.
Iran also ""flares,"" or burns into the atmosphere, about 7 percent of its natural gas. This is way above the world average, and is a huge waste of resources. Some believe the electricity that could be produced from this flared gas would be equal to about three Bushehr nuclear power plants.
Iran's development of the entire nuclear fuel cycle, not just nuclear power plants, is another misdirection of resources that could bring huge risks to Iran, even destruction. This process will cost tens of billions of scarce revenues. Not even the United States has developed the full fuel cycle.
Arguments that nuclear power is cheap get weaker when we divide the costs of developing the entire nuclear fuel cycle over each bit of electricity produced. Also, Iran has few uranium reserves. Reasonable estimates are that, given a 3,000 to 4,000 megawatt capacity for electricity production, Iran may have five to eight years of uranium in its own reserves. This has to be enriched, built into fuel pellets, put into fuel rods, and so forth.
Iran's argument for nuclear power is that it will have greater energy independence. How does that work when it will need to import uranium for its fuel cycle fairly soon? Another Iranian argument is that if it increasingly produces electricity with nuclear power, it can export more gas and oil. This would be a stronger argument if the Iranians first developed their oil and gas fields. But why set up the entire fuel cycle now, with all the political tensions this has produced and will continue to produce? Why not just develop the nuclear electricity plants, which Iran can do under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty? Iran hid some of its nuclear facilities for years, until an opposition group let the cat out of the bag. Why hide those facilities if there was nothing to hide?
Iran is engaged in a terrible misuse of its resources. There seems little sense in subsidizing the nuclear industry, imports of gasoline, the auto industry, overall energy, and more, in a country that must make sound economic decisions on every issue, every day, in order to make its people better off. Economics is not for donkeys. It is for development, prosperity, and peace. It's time for Iran's leadership to smell the coffee and start developing their country, so it gets along better with its neighbors and the world. The leaders claim to exist for their people. I wonder.
Paul Sullivan is a professor of economics at the National Defense University and Georgetown University, both in Washington DC.",What are some of the economic issues facing Iran according to the context?,"Iran is facing several economic issues including a huge subsidization for gasoline, diesel fuel, and electricity which may represent as much as 15-20 percent of GDP. This has led to an increase in demand for gasoline. The gasoline subsidy is also an indirect subsidy to Iran's automobile industry, which is contributing to air pollution and health problems. Another issue is the ""opportunity cost"" of the money for subsidizing and importing gasoline and subsidizing the non-competitive auto industry. These funds could be used for developing Iran's underinvested oil and gas industries. Iran also ""flares,"" or burns into the atmosphere, about 7 percent of its natural gas, which is a waste of resources. Furthermore, Iran's development of the entire nuclear fuel cycle is another misdirection of resources that could bring huge risks."
1939,"As part of the preparations for assignment 1, The Non Familiar, I looked at the work of photographers working with street portraits and their methods, with the intention of using street portraiture for the assignment.
Roswell Angier refers to to the work of Harry Callahan (1912-1999) in the 1950s, influenced by Walker Evans’s subway work. Angier explains that the work featured anonymous females, shot with a telephone lens, allowing more precise framing that was possible with Evan’s work shot with a hidden camera. Nonetheless, both photographers were working covertly, in a way that is not consistent with the assignment’s brief.
Mark Cohen is another photographer referenced by Angier as working with street portraiture, but literally shooting from the hip and not asking for permission. The Guardian explains, ‘Mark Cohen has spent decades doing hit-and-run street photography in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. His pictures are always taken from waist-height, so he can keep his wits about him – and he’s taken 800,000 shots he’s never even seen.’ This is perhaps an exaggeration for the purposes of a catchy first sentence to the article, but nonetheless it says something about Cohen’s practice.
An excellent reference book for contemporary street photography (including some portraiture) is Street Photography Now, which explores 48 different artists. But this comes up short with artists working with street portraits, instead focusing mainly on happenstance. I suspect that some of these artists have taken street portraits, with permission, it just happens to be coincidental to the intention of their work, rather than the main purpose – it therefore doesn’t get mentioned.
In an earlier post, I looked at the work of Diane Arbus (see here), whose street portraits are with permission even if focused on ‘freaks’. An observation was Arbus’ comment about her subjects, ‘I’m extremely likeable with them. I think I’m kind of two-faced.’ This duplicity does not sit comfortably, but it is of course also possible to be nice and genuinely interested in strangers when approaching them for photographs.
In contrast to Arbus, Helen Levitt (1913-2009) had a humanist outlook on street photography. Though she reportedly used a right-angled view finder to allow her to capture moments surreptitiously (Telfair).
It seems that most street photographers prefer to work with unsuspecting subjects, rather than ask permission for portraits. Understandable for a genre based on showing the extraordinary within banal street scenes; the aim is often to show what is happening in the natural course of events, rather than intervening.
There is a doubt however in my mind that in the pursuit of the ‘decisive moment’ concept some of these photographers may have been reluctant to admit that some of their images were set up, or at least that permission was asked.

Camiant selling to Tekelec for $130M

Save Article
Marlborough-based Camiant Inc. has agreed to be acquired for $130 million by a North Carolina IP and mobile data management company, Tekelec. According to Tekelec officials, the sale is expected to close within a week, subject to the usual closing conditions. Susie Kim Riley, founder and chief technology officer of Camiant, said that Tekelec would “make an ideal partnership to extend the power of policy control and create the foundation of the intelligent multi-service network.” Riley was named a Mass High Tech Woman to Watch honoree in 2006. According to Riley, the Camiant staff of more than 100 employees will stay on in Marlborough and become Tekelec employees once the sale closes. “This is a strategic acquisition and there are absolutely plans to keep on doing what we need to, to meet our 2010 and 2011 goals,” Riley said. For her part, Riley will become chief marketing officer of Tekelec and will remain based in the Marlborough office which will become “a center of excellence for Tekelec in the Boston area,” she said. Riley said it was Tekelec’s solid standing in the market that made it attractive as a buyer. “I think Tekelec is a company that has very sound footing in its business. It knows how to really scale a business,” she said. Camiant focuses on policy control, technology that regulates what types of applications can be used on a typical mobile or broadband platform, and what rights those applications have within the operating platform. The company, which was founded in 2003, has 30 customers worldwide, including Verizon, Vodafone, Sprint, Comcast and Cox Communications, and it lists more than 100 employees. Privately held Camiant had raised at least $16 million in funding from Matrix Partners, North Bridge Partners and Pilot House Ventures, according to federal documents. The company’s last funding round was in 2006, worth $8.1 million. Tekelec also purchased subscriber data management company Blueslice Networks Inc. of Montreal for $35 million.

188,"A Twitter user has discovered that Microsoft might be getting ready to “kill” the File History backup tool when the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update arrives. According to a tweet by WalkingCat, the Windows 10 build 16212 which Microsoft accidentally released a few days ago, doesn’t include the backup feature.
Specifically, the Twitter user notices that making new backups with File History is no longer supported. This could mean that Microsoft might be ready to completely remove the feature with the upcoming Fall Creators Update.
As mentioned above, the File History Backup Tool has been around since Windows 8. Microsoft introduced the feature with the famous OS back in 2012. File History allows users to backup incremental revisions of files and then restore them from a secondary storage device.
Of course, Microsoft updated File History in Windows 10. However, it seems like the company has something else in mind for backup once the Fall Creators Update drops.
New backup option and alternatives
Without a doubt, Microsoft will provide a backup option for Windows 10. Until the company confirms the removal of File History, users can still benefit from it.
As for the future, those in doubt can also create backups in Windows 10 using third-party software. There are a lot of options available for that, but it goes without saying that Microsoft will want to offer a built-in solution for Windows 10.
With the Windows 10 build 16212 already available due to an accidental release, it is possible we will have more information in this regard soon.
Dona Sarkar, head of the Windows Insider program, said that no new builds would be coming this week, so expect a new release in just a few days.",What is the speculation about the File History backup tool in the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update?,"The speculation is that Microsoft might be getting ready to “kill” the File History backup tool when the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update arrives.

Blurb:.
Excerpt:
The cut was small and not deep, it would stop bleeding in a matter of minutes.
Blood seeped from the wound. It trickled down Sarah’s wrist and pooled in her upturned hand.
He froze.
Changes overcame his body. Uncontrollable. Unknown.
Breath quickened. Heart pounded as loud as a horse’s gallop. Sarah hadn’t awakened. The pain from her cut was insubstantial compared to the pain of her sickness.
The thick, crimson liquid flowing from the wound was anything but insubstantial to Caderyn. Still unable to move, his eyes hadn’t wavered from the blood. The tray left his hands and clattered to the ground. His knees buckled and he sank to the floor, bringing himself an inch from the cut. The scent of blood filled his nostrils. Consumed all thought. Sight. He wanted to close his eyes and savor the reverent aroma filling his senses. Something awakened inside of him.
Foreign.
Monstrous.
Wrong.
He was hungry, yet didn’t want food. Thirsty, but didn’t want to reach for a cup of water. Another drop of blood welled from the cut. A growl tore from his throat.
It was the switch and it had been thrown.
One moment he was himself. The monster inside separate. Next the wall between the two vanished. He was the Behnshma. His humanity gone. Another growl. It echoed around the house. Filled his ears.
He was ravenous. The fact he hadn’t eaten in a little over a week ached his empty belly and burned his dry, parched throat. There were two pricks of pain in his top gum. Finger in his mouth, he found two long, sharp as knives, teeth. Like Elias. Like the wolves in the forest when they tore into a deer carcass. Their muzzles bloody, meat dangling from their mouths. Blood.
He knew what he wanted to do, what his body demanded he do. Caderyn licked his lips and his tongue nicked an elongated tooth. His own blood melted decadently over his tongue. A flood of senses erupted. Never had he tasted anything this wonderful. His mouth zinged with flavor. The blood coated his throat. He’d been dying of thirst his whole life but hadn’t known it. Warmth spread through his body.
His hands shook as he brought them to Sarah’s arm. Grasping her wrist and forearm he leaned toward the blood. Inch by inch. He was a magnet and her arm was the polar opposite.
Her inaudible yelp of fright permeated through the rushing noise in his ears. He tore his eyes away and met her wide-eyed startled ones.
Stop.
Fear was an acrid, burning stench in his nostrils. Her thoughts a chaotic jumble weaving through his mind. She tried to move her lethargic limbs. Tried to escape. To break free.
He flexed his hands, squeezing her arm as his gaze trailed from the vein in her neck to the one in her wrist right below the cut. The blood slowed and the edges of the wound begun to dry. The tangy, copper scent of the fresh liquid underneath her skin reached his nose. Caderyn listened to it pass through her veins. Faster and faster.
Ignoring his wife’s futile attempts to escape, he leaned closer and inhaled. A growl erupted from his throat. He bent. Licked the wound. Groaned. His cock hardened.
Sarah, panicked now, tried to yank her arm free. It was the most she’d moved in days. Growling, like a dog with his bone, he held down her upper arm and her squirming hand. Pushed it back until her forearm bowed, and the cut extended to him like a present.
Caderyn. Please. I beg you.
He was hurting her arm. Scaring her. She was begging.
Flicking his tongue over her wrist, he caught another drop of the thick liquid gold. Then another and another. It wasn’t enough. He bared his teeth, striking fast to sink them deep into her wrist. She gave a weak jerk. Caderyn drew her blood into his mouth with long pulls. His cock jerked and warmth spread inside his breeches. There was no stopping. Her struggles to escape were an annoying insect buzzing around the room. The pleas to stop were shouts in his head. Both were easy to ignore. Sarah ceased to struggle.
He was killing her.
He couldn’t stop.
And didn’t stop until she was dead.

2020,"Last weekend Sir Dave got up at the crack of dawn to get his smoker fired up to start smoking a 10 lb brisket for some friends we had coming over later in the evening for a little BBQ. I had such a busy week so I bought pre-made sides (don’t tell Ina). I basically got to show up and just eat – how great is that?
I am here to tell you that Dave’s day-long dedication to this big ole’ slab of meat paid off, big time. It was tender, juicy, incredibly flavorful and even got a “this is better than any brisket I’ve ever had in a restaurant” quote from one of our pals.
Dave used this recipe from extraordinarybbq.com, with a small change due to rain, that he thinks may have actually made it even better!

1/4 cup worcestershire
1/4 cup dale’s

1/4 cup real maple syrup
1 can coke or beer (your preference)
Ingredients for the Rub
2 tbs sea salt
2 tbs turbinado sugar
1 tbs black pepper
1 tbs chili powder
3 tsp onion powder
3 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp oregano
1 tsp ground mustard
1/4 tsp cayenne
First, trim the meat side of the brisket so that there is almost no fat and then trim the fat cap down to about 1/4 inch thickness.
Mix the marinade ingredients together – setting 1 cup aside for later – pour the rest over the brisket, cover, and put in the fridge for at least overnight.
Once the meat has marinated, remove from the fridge. Mix the rub together and set aside. Remove the brisket from the marinade, pat dry, and sprinkle a heavy coat of rub all over.
Then it’s time to start smoking! Smoke the brisket for at least 4 hours (Dave did 7 hours at 250) using a mix of hickory and fruit woods, and be sure to place an aluminum pan underneath the brisket to catch the juices. Due to pouring rain, Dave decided to finish the brisket in the oven. He placed the brisket in a large pan, poured the natural juices and the reserved 1 cup of marinade over the brisket, covered it with foil and cooked it at 300 degrees for an additional 3 hours until the internal temperature got to 200 degrees.
Once the cooking is all done, remove the brisket from the oven, and let rest for 30 minutes. Once rested, start to pull the meat apart with 2 forks, and discard excess fat. Place in a bowl and pour the natural juices and marinade over the shredded meat. Then EAT!
The awesome thing about having smoked brisket leftovers is that while it’s awesome on a bun with a side of baked beans, you can use it for a bunch of other yummy dishes. I made breakfast tacos one morning and smoked brisket nachos for lunch one day too. SO good! I’m actually sad it’s all gone. Dave, what are you up to next weekend? 😉
Cheers!

Looks irresistibly tasty! Love the variations. 🙂
Thanks so much! 🙂 I can’t wait until he makes it again!
Yep, our Daves would get along perfectly! This brisket looks amazing and for breakfast?!?!? ((Fist Bump))

Benched?
Redlich asked to sit out budget vote
By Saranac Hale Spencer
GUILDERLAND Supervisor Kenneth Runion, a Democrat on the town board’s three-member majority, has asked that Republican Councilman Warren Redlich recuse himself from the town’s budget process.
“He doesn’t want to answer questions about the budget,” Redlich said yesterday in response to Runion's request, which came in a letter to Redlich dated Sept. 30.
“This letter is in response to your e-mail containing a number of questions concerning the proposed 2009 Town Budget,” begins Runion's letter. “It is my understanding that your law firm still continues to represent clients in the Guilderland Justice Court… As a Town Board member, you have shared responsibility over the town budget and the hiring, firing and discipline of town employees. The town budget is voted on as a whole package. There is no line item vote. As a number of your questions concern the police department and court, I believe you have a conflict of interest which prohibits you from participating in the budget process.”
In August, Runion had sent a memo to town board members detailing the budget schedule and stating, “A change is order.” Since Runion believes that Redlich has a conflict of interest, he did away with the three workshop meetings usually held for the board to discuss the budget, saying Redlich “may have an issue participating in one or more of the department budgets that would be discussed at the workshops.”
Instead, the board received a copy of the proposed budget and then held a special meeting on Sept. 23 where Runion explained it with a PowerPoint presentation.
Before that meeting, Redlich e-mailed several pages of questions regarding the budget to board members and the media. Many of his questions identified the budget line concerned and asked why it went up or down and what caused the change. When asked for answers after the presentation, Runion said that he would respond in writing. Yesterday, Runion said he’d be happy to answer all of Redlich’s questions after The Redlich Law Firm commits to not accepting Guilderland cases.
“I’m not going to cut my income because Ken Runion wants to make a show,” Redlich responded through The Enterprise. His firm, which includes five lawyers, has a screen, he said, so he is in no way involved with the cases his associates are handling in Guilderland.
“That’s just a charade,” Runion said of the screen, maintaining that, if one lawyer in a practice has a conflict of interest, all lawyers in the practice do.
“Ken Runion is not my guide on ethics,” Redlich said, adding with sarcasm, “I don’t think I could sleep at night.”
Soon after Redlich took his seat in January on what had been an all-Democratic town board, town justices Denise Randall and John Bailey both Democrats wrote to Judge Thomas Breslin of the Albany County Court, “Because the Town Board sets the Court’s budget, including the salaries of the Judges, and that of the Police Department, whose officers regularly testify in the attorney’s cases… we perceived a potential conflict of interest.” They go on to reference opinions provided to them by the Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics which suggest that they recuse themselves.
“It should be noted that the People do not allege that Mr. Redlich has behaved improperly at any time,” concludes a Feb. 25 response to the judges’ letter from District Attorney David Soares’s office. “…Mr. Redlich must be disqualified from appearing in his capacity as a defense attorney in Guilderland Town Court… The purpose of disqualifying the lawyer/legislator/town board member is to avoid the public perception that he is misusing his or her influence over the police and courts to benefit his client.”
The cases that Redlich had had before the Guilderland Court when he took office last winter were transferred to the Bethlehem Town Court, Redlich said, which he thought was fair.
The Guilderland Police are still involved in some of those cases, even if the Guilderland town judges aren’t, Runion said, which still constitutes a conflict.
“What’s underlying this,” Redlich answered, is the implication that Redlich would seek retribution towards an officer who testified against his client in one of his firm’s cases. “It’s offensive to suggest I would do that,” he said.
“Those budgets are over 50 percent of the town budget,” Runion said of the police department and court budgets. Later, he reiterated that it isn’t a line-item vote and said, “If you have a conflict on one aspect of a budget, you have a conflict with the whole budget.”
“He set this process up,” Redlich said of Runion’s budget schedule. Now, Redlich said, “He’s manufacturing an excuse not to answer questions.”

1780,"Hi everyone! It’s been a week since my sad post, and since then things have been looking up! I’m so happy to be out of my blah mood and back to normal. Life in Alaska is much better when you’re in the mood to hike and run again! Since I had such a long list of bad things last week, I’ve decided to make another list dedicated to all the awesome things going on in my life right now:
- Nutella. I eat it out of the jar with a spoon when I’m craving chocolate. Does anyone else do that?
- Taking long, lazy float raft trips down the Kenai River with an apricot beer in hand and perfect warm weather. I could get used to this!
Yes, I know I have a half marathon this weekend. I only drank half!
We saw at least 50 bald eagles during the trip!
- Actually sticking to my goals that I made last week! Coffee, you have no power over me…
- My parents sending me treats from their vacation to Ocean City, Maryland. These are my favorite things to eat at the beach and my parents know it. They’re the best!
- The fact that I only work 2 days this week because of my upcoming half marathon. Running is much better than working!
- My new TOMS sailboat shoes that Andrew got me for my birthday! I wear them as much as possible! Here I am wearing them while hanging out on an old sailboat near the Salmon Bake.
- I saw a breeching humpback whale yesterday while taking a tour with our company. No pictures because I feel like an iPhone can’t even capture that kind of thing. But oh my god, it was amazing!!!!
- Low key hiking to beautiful lakes we didn’t know existed. Oh how I love Alaska!
- Having fabulous friends who always put me in a good mood. My husband is included in this as well :)
I think the fact that I changed my mindset on my half marathon has helped me totally turn my mood around this week. Of course I’m nervous – when am I not nervous about a race? – but I will get through it and make it as fun as possible. I’ve also started working on my resume and looking for jobs so I’m feeling a bit better about the future. Plus the weather was perfect for my days off and that’s always a plus! Today should be my last run before the race and I’m curious to see how it goes. I’m hoping for an easy, uneventful few miles to get me excited about the race. Wish me luck!
What fun things are putting you in a good mood this week? How do you like to eat Nutella?
Those TOMS are so cute!
I love Nutella- by the spoon, on sandwiches, on top of ice cream. I had it on crackers every day when I studied abroad. & last weekend I went to brunch & had it on top of a waffle. Best waffle ever :)
Good luck at your half this weekend!
Thanks! And oh my god, on top of ice cream? Why have I never thought of that!
YAY! So glad you are feeling better! This week my sweet dog Lilly is putting me in the best mood. She got groomed earlier this week and looks too cute. I can’t help but smile when I look at her :)
Awww adorable! Dogs are the best for putting me in a good mood :)
I am so glad that things are turning around for you! Those TOMS are adorable! And yeah, who doesn’t eat Nutella by the spoonful?
Thanks! And I thought I was weird for a second, but I’m glad other people do it too. I feel like it’s supposed to be a condiment and not the main dessert but I don’t care!
I put Nutella on apples. Makes me feel like its healthy :)
Haha there you go, that totally works! I might have to try that sometime!
I definitely eat it by the spoonful. I avoid eating it now because I have no self-control, but it’s definitely a pick me upper :) I can’t believe you saw that many bald eagles! That’s so amazing and good luck on your race
Yeah my self control with Nutella is pretty low. And yeah, the bald eagle situation is nuts right now! The salmon are running so all the rivers are lined with eagles trying to steal some!
Good luck on your upcoming race! Those pictures look beautiful! Oh how I need to make it back to Alaska for a trip!!!!
Yeah you do!
I do not eat nutella, but maybe I should? ;-) Your weeks sounds perfect! What beautiful places! This week running with a group of high school kids is putting me in a good mood. I wake up at 5 AM ish and wonder why I’m leaving my bed but by 6 AM I’m happy as a clam and by 7 I feel really accomplished and glad to have gone! Haha.This was a bounce back week for me too after being so sick last week. I wondered if I’d find my mojo again but…looks like I did. Good luck on your half!
Yes you should, you will get addicted and eat it constantly! So yummy! And I wish I had a group that awesome that I could run with. It sounds like fun!
Hooray for feeling happy! My favorite are Teddy Grams or animal crackers dipped in Nutella! yummm. Good luck in your race! Those TOMS are super cute : D
Oh I’ve done that with Annie’s graham cracker bunnies! It’s so good!
So many great things in one post!! Love your Toms, the scenery (Eagles and Whales), and nutella out of a jar…yes please! :D Glad you are feeling better! Have a fabulous weekend!
Thanks!
it seems so beautiful there!",What are some of the things that have improved the author's mood in the past week?,"Some of the things that have improved the author's mood include eating Nutella, taking float raft trips down the Kenai River, sticking to her goals, receiving treats from her parents, working only 2 days due to an upcoming half marathon, wearing her new TOMS sailboat shoes, seeing a breeching humpback whale, hiking to beautiful lakes, having supportive friends and changing her mindset about her half marathon."

Morehouse Screening of ‘Crown Heights’ Brings Awareness to National Problem Unequal justice for poor and minority defendants emphasized in new film
Colin Warner spent 21 years in prison for a murder that he didn’t commit. And he came to Morehouse College recently for a film debut that warned Atlanta University Center students that his story could easily be theirs.
Warner’s heartbreaking journey to freedom was depicted in the new film “Crown Heights,” which is being shown in select movie theaters across the country. More than 600 people gathered at the Martin Luther King Jr. Chapel to see the flick in a special screening of the movie.... Head Coach Rich Freeman said that he is looking forward to seeing his talented team show what they can do and eliminate the mistakes that plagued them in their 23-10 loss against Arkansas-Pine Bluff. UAPB is a school that plays on the Division I-FCS level that the Maroon Tigers dominated in leading 10-0 heading into halftime last week.
Morehouse Scholars Challenged To Be Tech Leaders In “Brave New World”
When cars aren’t driven by people and instead drive people around, when IBM Watson gives more legal or medical advice than humans, and when apps use facial recognition to tell when someone is lying, Morehouse Men must be there to decipher this “brave new world,” said Robert M. Franklin Jr. ’75, Morehouse College’s 10th president. “Our challenge, Morehouse, is to live amidst that change and volatility and help guide it to human betterment,” Franklin said during the College’s Opening Convocation on Thursday, Sept. 14. “This is the simple art of living together, of building community and treating every person with dignity and respect.”
For Jeffrey Butler, the decision to come to Morehouse College had more to do with obtaining a top-tier education. “Education is universal no matter where you go,” said Butler, 20. “As an African-American man, I needed a safe haven where I can learn about my true self.” A native of Fort Washington, Md., Butler is a junior seeking a dual degree — in applied physics at Morehouse and mechanical engineering at another institution.
There’s a story about legendary Morehouse College basketball coach and athletic director Arthur McAfee Jr. and his father, Arthur McAfee Sr., that few may know about.
According to Dick Russell’s book, “Black Genius: Inspirational Portraits of America’s Black Leaders,” Arthur Sr. was approached by a woman in their hometown of Witchita, Kansas. Her son had been a star basketball player in high school and a great student, but began to stray when he got to junior college.
At Morehouse College, we promote the excellence that our scholars show each day, and that includes our student-athletes.
Coming off the heels of another championship win by our Morehouse Cross Country team in October, our Maroon Tigers basketball team, led by alumnus Grady Brewer '80, is in the midst of another amazing season with an overall record of 8-0 and 3-0 in the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference!
Former Spelman College President Beverly Daniel Tatum and AT&T executive Marvy Moore have joined the Morehouse College Board of Trustees. The two nationally respected leaders in education and business raise even higher the level of excellence for a Board that features some of the nation’s top executives and preeminent leaders across a variety of industries..",Who has been named as the new chief executive of The Company Lab?,Marcus Shaw ’00 has been named as the new chief executive of The Company Lab.

2348,"I'm reluctant to add yet another opinion, but, oh what the heck: For me, lenses basically already solve the record problem. The only missing thing is to integrate them better with record declaration syntax. Having to rely on TH and then write a makeLenses splice is just too much friction to have lenses added everywhere automatically. TH makes compiles more fragile and slower, and worst of all introduces a declaration order constraint in the source file. So I declare by hand, but even at one line per lens, it's still too much friction, because after all they don't start saving you lines until you want to update a nested field. In addition, I can't use unqualified names because I would want to import only the record lenses unqualified, not the rest of the module. So I'd have to move all the data types into individual modules, because giant long import lists is definitely way too much friction. But the separate module is no good, because that in turns doesn't let you preserve invariants by restricting exports. So if I were doing the GSoC thing, here's what I would do: 1 - Add an option to add a 'deriving (Lens)' to record declarations. That makes the record declare lenses instead of functions. That's already most of the problem solved, for me, because it removes the TH friction. 2 - The next step is to allow 'deriving (ClassyLens)', which declares lenses plus the typeclasses to allow shared names. Then when you write 'import M (Record(..))', the (..) will import the stuff generated by 'deriving (ClassyLens)', i.e. the class methods. Now you can drop the record name prefixing and import unqualified to drop the module name qualification as well. It's still not ideal because you would have to add the unqualified 'import M (Record(..))', but is better than having to write out the list of fields every single time. And actually I'm not sure I could use even that, because record field names are usually the same as what you want to name the variable, e.g.: ""name = parent.name .^ person"". A hardcoded record field thing like SORF has the edge here because you can write ""name = person.parent.name"" without 'name' clashing. But in every other respect, lenses fit much better into the rest of the language and are much more powerful for much less (i.e. none!) ad-hoc language level complexity to support them, so to me they clearly win at power to weight ratio. But I don't mind always qualifying, e.g. 'name = Person.parent . Person.name .^ person' and avoiding the whole classes and unqualified import hassle, so just step 1 is basically problem solved (in fact, this is what I already do, just without the automatic lens generation). Alas, not everyone shares my attitude towards qualification. In fact, I'm probably in a small minority (hi Henning!). Which is sad, because just doing #1 would be so easy! Maybe I should just go do it myself, it's not like it would conflict with any of the other proposed extensions.",What are the two steps proposed to solve the record problem with lenses in programming?,"The two steps proposed are: 1 - Add an option to add a 'deriving (Lens)' to record declarations, which makes the record declare lenses instead of functions, removing the Template Haskell friction. 2 - The next step is to allow 'deriving (ClassyLens)', which declares lenses plus the typeclasses to allow shared names.

773,"New 'diner' will help Utah's homeless veterans share a meal
Veteran Garie Spencer spins around on a red stool at a round table emblazoned with a 1960s Coca-Cola logo and says he feels right at home.
""It's like going down to the old Walgreens [in downtown Provo] and having ice cream,"" says Spencer, who lives in Salt Lake City's Freedom Landing on North Temple with 108 other formerly homeless veterans.
On Thursday, the complex will celebrate the opening of Freedom Diner, a kitchen and dining room where the veterans will be able to gather for coffee in the morning, cook for one another and share meals.
""It's nice,"" says Vietnam veteran Charlie Anderson, a cook who has had to cobble together a kitchen, of sorts, with an array of small appliances everything from an electric skillet to a rice cooker in his apartment. ""We've complained about this long enough.""
Freedom Landing, owned and operated by the Housing Authority of Salt Lake City, is in an old Days Inn, so the motel rooms-turned-apartments lack kitchens.
The new diner just off the lobby was once a breakfast room and, after the Housing Authority turned the motel into transitional housing for homeless veterans, a television room.
Now, it is decorated in Americana, with big blue and white floor tiles, the Coca-Cola tables and stools, and a huge bank of red cabinets stocked with canned goods, pasta, rice, cereal and even toilet paper, donated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
Veterans will have music from a jukebox where they can play CDs, dock their music players or listen to the radio.
One of the two stoves is wheelchair accessible, as are some of the counters and tables.
""Some of them were cooks in the Army. They'll have to cut their recipes in half,"" joked Diana Leka, director of homeless programs for the housing authority.
""There are just some things you can't cook in a microwave,"" says Kelly Olsen, one of the five female veterans living at Freedom Landing. She served in the Navy in the 1980s.
The diner will be good for making friends, she says. ""I tend to isolate sometimes. I think we're going to have a blast here.""
Charles Oliver, who served in the Navy and Army, pats his belly and says he doesn't expect to eat too much in the diner.
""I gotta reduce a little bit,"" he says.
Nonetheless, says Oliver, ""This is a real blessing.""
The goal of transitional housing like Freedom Landing is to help the veterans gain stability so they can live independently and work. The Department of Veterans Affairs has five case managers on site who work with the veterans, and the VA pays the housing authority a per diem amount for each veteran, which covers the agency's costs. Between 40 percent and 50 percent of the veterans at Freedom Landing have jobs and pay 30 percent of their rent, Leka says.
The project began three years ago as part of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki's goal of ending veteran homelessness by 2015.
""We may be the first of the states and Salt Lake may be the first community in ending homeless veterans,"" says Bill Nighswonger, executive director of the housing authority.
Fewer homeless veterans
The number of veterans living on the streets in Utah was 33 in 2012, and another 297 were in transitional housing funded through the Department of Veterans Affairs or in area shelters, says Al Hernandez, who runs the VA's homeless program. Hernandez expects the 2013 numbers due out in April to be even lower. The federal government has been spending millions of dollars to try to end veteran homelessness.

1145,"Metropolitan Herman visits Church in Russia
On June 1, 2003, His Beatitude, Metropolitan Herman, Primate of the Orthodox Church in America, began his first official visit to the Russian Orthodox Church at the invitation of His Holiness, Patriarch Aleksy II of Moscow and All Russia.
“While it has been widely reported that Patriarch Aleksy has experienced numerous health issues in recent months, his condition is not serious enough to preclude the one-week visit, the first since Metropolitan Herman’s election as Primate in July 2002,” according to the Very Rev. John Matusiak, OCA Communications Director. “Metropolitan Herman is anxious to visit with the Patriarch personally and assure him of ongoing prayers for the full restoration of his health.”
Upon his arrival in Moscow, Metropolitan Herman, accompanied by Protopresbyter Robert Kondratick, was greeted by His Eminence, Metropolitan Kyrill of Smolensk and Kalingrad, Chairman of the Department of External Church Relations of the Moscow Patriarchate, at Moscow’s Sheremetevo Airport.
On June 3, Metropolitan Herman will visit the renown Monastery of the Holy Trinity and Saint Sergius of Radonezh in Sergiev Posad, the Russian Orthodox Church’s major monastery a brief drive from Moscow, where he will pray before the relics of Saint Sergius and Saint Innocent Veniaminov, the 19th century Metropolitan of Moscow who spent many years as a missionary priest and later bishop in Alaska. He will also deliver an address to the faculty and students of the Moscow Theological Academy and Seminary, located on the monastery grounds, in which he will reflect on the close relationship between the Churches in Russia and America and highlight the significance of the forthcoming return of the wonderworking Tikhvin Icon of the Mother of God to the Tikhvin monastery near Novgorod in 2004.
The Church of the Great Martyr Catherine in Moscow will be the site of the hierarchical Divine Liturgy on June 4, the Feast of the Leavetaking of Holy Pascha, which Metropolitan Herman will celebrate with Archimandrite Zacchaeus, OCA Representative to the Moscow Patriarchate, and a number of visiting hierarchs and other clergy. The church, which has served as the OCA’s Representation Church for a decade, continues to undergo extensive renovations and improvements necessitated by years of neglect and use for secular purposes during the communist era. Under Father Zacchaeus, who also serves as Dean of Saint Catherine’s, the program of improvements initiated by the Very Rev. Daniel Hubiak, the OCA’s first representative in Moscow, are continuing at an impressive pace.
Later the same evening, Metropolitan Herman will concelebrate the All-Night Vigil for the Great Feast of the Ascension at the Patriarchal Cathedral of the Theophany, popularly known as “Yelokhovsky cathedral” in reference to the former village in which it is located.
On the Great Feast of the Ascension, June 5, Metropolitan Herman will celebrate the Divine Liturgy in the recently-rebuilt Cathedral of Christ the Savior. Originally built in the late 1800s, the massive cathedral, Russia’s largest, was demolished in the 1930s by order of Joseph Stalin, who intended but failed to erect a massive “Palace of the Soviets” in its place. Patriarch Aleksy initiated reconstruction of the cathedral in the mid-1990s, culminating in the church’s consecration in August 2000. On the evening of the Feast, Metropolitan Herman will meet privately with Patriarch Aleksy at his residence.
On June 6, prior to his departure for the United States, Metropolitan Herman will meet with the US Ambassador to the Russian Federation, Alexander Vershbow, to discuss matters of mutual concern.
Photos of Metropolitan Herman’s visit will be posted on the OCA web site at and will appear in the July-August issue of “The Orthodox Church” newspaper.",Who invited Metropolitan Herman for his first official visit to the Russian Orthodox Church in 2003?,"His Holiness, Patriarch Aleksy II of Moscow and All Russia invited Metropolitan Herman for his first official visit to the Russian Orthodox Church in 2003."
909,"Mercedes, BMW Hybrids Lure CEOs Who May Avoid a Prius
(Corrects release date of BMW ActiveHybrid 7 to this spring in eighth paragraph of story published Feb. 25. Incorrect information was based on BMW press release.)
Feb. 25 (Bloomberg) -- To the great oxymorons of our time, like “military intelligence,” “clean coal,” “reality TV” and “easy mortgage loan,” I propose to add “green luxury sedan.”
Titans of industry flaunt power, prestige as they sweep through traffic, not environmental consciousness, right?
So for the past few years, the only choice for chief eco-sensitive officers has been Toyota’s $110,000 hybrid Lexus LS 600h L, sporting a whopping 5-liter, 438 horsepower V-8 married to an electric motor -- the low-emission duck among preening swans.
No longer. Let me introduce you to the BMW ActiveHybrid 7 and the Mercedes-Benz S-Class Hybrid. Big, bruising and beautiful, these two sedans for the executive set have taken a cue from Toyota’s playbook. When the Germans start producing hybrid luxury sedans, however tentatively, it signals an industry shift.
Still, before you invite the president of Greenpeace to a Four Seasons lunch, let’s qualify those Environmental Protection Agency numbers. The Mercedes S400 gets 19 miles per gallon on Manhattan’s Park Avenue and 26 on the Long Island Expressway. The BMW’s results aren’t official, but I saw numbers of around 16 while idling on Worth Street and 24 when whipping to Chappaqua on the Saw Mill Parkway. The Lexus gets 20 and 22.
Prius numbers? Hardly. That’s because none of the three can move under electric power alone. The gas engine is shut off when stopped and the electric motor temporarily provides power. It can also provide extra torque when moving. Toyota’s Prius, which can briefly run on electric power alone, gets 51 mpg in town.
Dismal V-12
Still, the fuel consumption is about 15 percent to 20 percent better than the regular V-8 models. Both the 7 and S-Class also are available with 12-cylinder engines, which get a dismal 11 to 13 mpg around town. (The V-12s, which have massive premiums, are the equivalent of a pricey wristwatch with fancy complicated mechanics -- unnecessary, but see how it moves!)
You can buy the S400 today, leaving BMW in the dust as showrooms must wait until this spring for the ActiveHybrid 7.
Moneymen talk figures, so to price: The BMW will go for $103,125, with a more desirable long-wheelbase version starting at $107,000. That’s a $20,000-plus premium over the gas-only version, or the salary of a worker in the mailroom.
Mercedes has positioned the S400 at less than $90,000, making it the economy player in the S-Class lineup -- $3,600 less than the S550. That’s a bottle of 1982 Chateau Petrus.
Audi Plan
Other than the hybrid badging, both sedans look identical to their all-gas counterparts. Which brand you choose partly depends on which look appeals -- the BMW’s modern slickness versus the strong solidity of the Mercedes. (Audi plans to show a full hybrid based on the new A8 at the Geneva Motor Show.)
In terms of comfort, the 7 Series’ front seats are my favorite of any modern car, comfortable for bodies big and small. The back seat is huge, and the overall padding throughout the cabin is lovely to feel. Every button and knob is firm and pleasant to the touch -- the best build quality of any Bimmer.
Not that the Mercedes is a slouch. I hauled three passengers to Delaware from New York and they later complained that their hotel bed wasn’t nearly the equal of the S400’s cabin. It’s got beautiful burl walnut and leather all around.
The big difference in price comes from the S400’s power deficit over the 7. The Mercedes is a comparatively gentle machine with a combined 295 horses and 284 pound-feet of torque out of its V-6 and electric motor. You can get to 60 mph in about 7.2 seconds.
German Roads
I experienced no real lack of zing, however. The S-Class is not supposed to make burnouts at traffic lights anyhow. It’s bred for the wide-open roads of Germany, and on that Delaware drive I made excellent time without even approaching the electronically controlled top speed of 130 mph.
The ActiveHybrid 7 Series is a power player, with a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V-8 married to an electric motor with a combined 455 horsepower and 515 pound-feet of torque. It’ll get to 60 mph in 4.7 seconds. Yowza.
Throttle and suspension settings include comfort, normal, sport and sport sharp, and they change the temperament faster than a CEO on a golf trip being called to appear before Congress. Both cars are more manageable in traffic and windy roads than oversize SUVs.
And in these days of foregone bonuses and carbon footprints, CEOs may like to show that it’s not just the color of their money that’s green.

BMW ActiveHybrid 7 at a Glance
Engines: 3.5-liter V-6 and electric motor with 295 horsepower; 4.4-liter V-8 and electric motor with 455 hp.
Transmissions: 7-speed automatic; 8-speed automatic.
Speed: 0 to 60 mph in 7.2 seconds; 4.7.
Gas mileage per gallon: 19 city, 26 highway; 16, 24 (estimated).
Price as tested: $105,230; $107,300 (estimated).
Best feature: Decent gas mileage in a classic S-Class package; rip-roaring performance with all the comfort.
Worst features: Both are mild hybrids, which don’t get the same gas improvements as full hybrids.
Target buyer: The executive who wants to be seen to be green.

Description
Matisse painted this canvas in the summer of 1917 while being chauffeured by his son Pierre toward an airport on the outskirts of Paris. Suddenly, Matisse decided to paint the road from inside the car, which proved challenging, as zooming traffic forced the artist to keep the windows shut and constantly rocked the old Renault back and forth. Matisse nonetheless produced a novel view of life in the modern automobile.","When and where did Henri Matisse paint ""The Windshield, On the Road to Villacoublay""?","Henri Matisse painted ""The Windshield, On the Road to Villacoublay"" in the summer of 1917 while being chauffeured by his son Pierre toward an airport on the outskirts of Paris."

I'm at school. I love coming to campus on the weekends when there aren't too many people around. I especially love that, as a grad student, I'm able to let myself into locked buildings. That is how much of a nerd I am.
Part of the reason I came to campus today was to get away from the distractions of home. I have an amazing talent for putting things off and finding anything to do besides what I really should be doing. Everybody does this, I know, but I think I even outdid myself last night: instead of doing my homework, I cut my own hair. Frankly, I was afraid of what I would've done today if I didn't get out of the house. (Maybe a homemade prison-style tattoo?) And now look: I'm blogging! Sigh.

Ugh! This has been a bad week for me when it comes to exercise. I am doing a check in for the last weeks; last week was great, this week not so much. Last week, I got in 5 workouts- 3 runs (about 30 minutes each) and 2 sessions of 'Ripped in 30'. This week my daughter started having sleep issues and we're trying to get ready for company so I only got in 3 30 minute runs. I did finish week 5 of Couch 2 5K and the last run was HARD but I am proud of myself for doing it. I had to run for 20 minutes straight; this used to be nothing for me but since I'm pretty much out of shape, it was super rough.
I'm hoping to get back on track next week with at least 5 workouts (preferably 6) per week and get back to using My Fitness Pal to track what I'm eating. My clothes are getting tight so I really need to get on top of monitoring my food intake.
I'm definitely going to commit to regular exercise for the month of July.

Yeah, miniguns and m60s and rpgs
Now that is not a rational idea.<br />
Hence the reason many countries have laws<br />
that prevents most people obtaining or holding<br />
a firearm license.
why not, that is what background checks are for, it is your right to bear arms, called 2nd amendment, and every citizen in the United States has a right to go buy a gun, not for duck hunting but to prevent government tryrany, like what happened in Germany, China, Australia, North Korea, etc etc etc .......
2nd amendment was not brought, this is what our country was founded on, for the people was armed and the government was not, now its backwards, I think that the White House should turn in all there semi-auto and machine guns first...........
I never said that, Americans have a right by the 2nd amendment to bear arms for protection agianst idiots that shoot our children and agianst a tryranical government
I find a fishing rod is more useful most of the time.

1661,"This Ramadan, Let’s Finish What We Started
Last year, Zaytuna College met a monumental milestone when we purchased the flagship building for our campus atop Berkeley’s “Holy Hill,” a center for faith and higher education. We had found ourselves a home—a permanent academic address for Islam in America.
Now we need to make that home ours. We have already moved our administrative offices there, but we need to prepare the campus for our students and faculty. We need to craft classrooms, study lounges, a library—and a serene space for worship and reflection.
For this, we need to raise $4 million for renovations. “Muslims have always ensured that beauty and learning walk hand-in-hand,” says Waheed Rasheed, our Vice President for Administrations and Operations. “We want our students to experience a campus that inspires them to learn and grow—and we want the American Muslim community to experience a campus that inspires them about the future of their faith in this country.”
This Ramadan, you can help us finish what we started.
Last year, we unveiled our Brick by Brick campaign to raise money for the new campus. Many of you came through, dedicating bricks in your name and the names of your loved ones for each gift of $1,000. This builders’ wall, once displayed at Zaytuna, will be an enduring testament to the pioneers who made our vision a reality.
You can still be one of them. Join our Brick by Brick campaign this Ramadan.
Scholar Studying American Islam’s “Crisis of Authority” to Headline Zaytuna Convocation
Dr. Zareena Grewal, an emerging Muslim scholar who teaches at Yale University, has been named to deliver the keynote remarks at the 2013 Convocation (Aug. 27), where we welcome our newest freshman class. This year will mark the first time that all four cohorts—freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors—will be represented at the Zaytuna Convocation.
Currently, Dr. Grewal is completing a major work, Islam is a Foreign Country, about American Islam’s “crisis of authority.” In the book, she “follows the journeys of American Muslim youth who travel in global, underground Islamic networks” to seek a religious home. Her publisher, New York University Press, continues: “By examining the tension between American Muslims’ ambivalence toward the American mainstream and their desire to enter it, Grewal puts contemporary debates about Islam in the context of a long history of American racial and religious exclusions.”
Dr. Grewal, a historical anthropologist and documentary filmmaker, teaches courses at Yale on Muslims in America, U.S. cultural and political interests in the Middle East, and ethnographic and documentary film. In 2004, she directed and produced By the Dawn’s Early Light: Chris Jackson’s Journey to Islam, a film that explores the scrutiny American Muslims face about their patriotism toward their country.
Previous speakers at the Zaytuna Convocation include James A. Donahue, then the president of the Graduate Theological Union; Sherman A. Jackson, the King Faisal Chair in Islamic Thought and Culture at USC; and Sulayman S. Nyang, professor at Howard University.
“Even Your Dreams Should Be in Arabic”
Dr. Fadi Elhin sees the effects of seven weeks at Zaytuna College every day. He sees it in the student who arrived in June and did not know the Arabic alphabet. Now, that student challenges himself by striving to access the Qur’an and hadith. For Dr. Elhin, the director of the eight-week Summer Arabic Intensive, these past seven weeks have been a revelation.
“I have some students who basically had no idea what Arabic even looked like, whether it starts from right to left or left to right,” he says. “But now, we have many of them being able to read, write, and speak—not at the highest level, but they can communicate.”
This Friday, Aug. 2, the Arabic Intensive will hold a graduation ceremony for the 57 students who completed the summer program. Zaytuna has held the program each summer for the past six years, and this year’s program has been the largest to date.
It’ll also be Dr. Elhin’s first graduation with Zaytuna, and he’s looking forward to it. He studied Arabic and Islamic Studies in Jordan and, after stops in New York and Montana, arrived at Zaytuna this June .“Zaytuna,” he says, “gives you freedom if you want to learn the language. You have it in the very beautiful conditions for these students to study here.”
Under his leadership, meanwhile, the program has already made subtle changes—everything from reducing extracurricular activities to adjusting for a more Ramadan-friendly schedule—that have significantly improved the learning experience.
“To succeed in seven or eight weeks,” says Elhin, “students should have nothing to do except Arabic this summer. We limit all other things, except for studying. That’s why if you leave everything to spend eight weeks to focus on the language, even your dreams should be in Arabic.”
Spread the Word: Zaytuna Seeks Controller
As Zaytuna College continues to grow by leaps and bounds, its operational and administrative needs are also growing. Now, we have an immediate opening for a Controller to oversee our accounting and finance functions. We ask you to spread the word to anyone who may be interested in applying.
The Controller reports to the VP of Administration and Operations and is responsible for the overall management of accounting functions and the provision of financial data and guidance to the Zaytuna Operations, including the monthly closing process and production of actual financial results, cash flow management and reporting, purchase order control, budgets, cash management, and other processes and internal controls.

669,"They will now battle the USA for the gold medal at 5am AEST on Monday morning as they seek to replicate their performance from 2006 when they were crowned FIBA World Cup Champions.
After breezing through their first four games of the tournament, the Opals were forced to fight until the final siren against Spain and trailed by eight points at three-quarter time.
Liz Cambage (33 points, 15 rebounds, four blocks) had enjoyed a battle against the Spanish front court (and the crowd) throughout the game but she was determined not to let this one slip, scoring six quick points to open the fourth quarter.
Katie Ebzery drilled a corner three as well to give the Opals a 9-0 run and then Astor Ndour, Spanish starting forward, fouled out.
Cambage flirted with fouling out herself after a technical but Laura Nicholls fouled out instead for Spain only a couple of minutes later and the visitors were in the bonus with the game tied inside the last 3:30.
Cayla George (nine points, 11 rebounds, two assists) then stepped up, scoring five in a row including a big three-pointer from an offensive rebound to gain the ascendancy and Australia picked up their defensive intensity as well with blocks from Cambage and O'Hea.
The two combined again on the following possession with O'Hea (four points, two assists) picking up the steal and Cambage finishing a broken play with a lay-up.
That put the Opals up by five and they staved off a Spanish miracle with more lockdown defence, preventing any late three-point attempts as they finished the game with an 8-1 run and a 22-8 final term.

The game did not look like it was headed to a thrilling conclusion after the Opals dominated the first quarter, a trademark of their 2018 FIBA World Cup campaign.
They pushed the pace early, beating Spain in transition even off made baskets and Bec Allen (eight points, two steals) maintained her form from the Quarter-Final with an early three-pointer while Steph Talbot (two points, eight assists) also impressed.
Cambage recorded nine points to quarter-time as well, putting her team up by 15 at one stage before Spain reeled in the deficit with a 9-2 run to ending the opening stanza.
Their defence then tightened up in the second quarter, sending back lay-up attempts by Ebzery (ten points, three assists) and Sami Whitcomb (five points) to hold the Opals scoreless for over four minutes.
Consecutive three-pointers from Alba Torrens then drew Spain level before the home side moved in front right on the half-time buzzer for their first lead of the game.
Ebzery had the response to start the third, scoring the first two baskets including a bail-out shot clock buzzer beater and that sparked an 8-2 run for the Aussies.
Spain were not going away though, answering with an 8-1 run themselves and the crowd was delirious when they went into three-quarter time with an eight-point edge.
The Opals will now meet the USA for the first time since the 2014 World Cup Semi-Final when the Americans prevailed by 12 points.

79,"[Jenial Thanks to Janine Mendes-Franco, of Global Voices Online, for selecting two posts, about Our rising emigration and the changes in Our inner voice.]
What kind of voter movement would make the biggest difference in Our deteriorating PanoRama?
First, what would a voter movement be and is one needed? Taking the last question first: crime up, murders way up, education dropping even more than its Third World rating would predict, corruption up, jobs down, economy tanking, government bond debt limit reached, government credit rating dropping, stupid political leaders playing kissie-assie with each other, emigration rising... If anyone thinks the current sewage dump of """"""leaders"""""" is going to change their thieving, me-first bullshit, then they are retarded and should not vote.
As for why a voter movement and not some other ""peaceful"" process: short of a violent overthrow and non-existent recall solutions, the simplest and most direct path to change Our (non)government is through the elections. Since every electoral office is up for grabs every 4 years, the only real chance We have to make minimal or wholesale changes is at the ballot box.
Moving on. The voter movement I envision would obviously have to cross party lines, galvanize abut 350,000 - 425,000 votes and focus on taking out entrenched Fools.
Why?
1) Cross party lines: The average voter wants to feel that his or her vote ""wins"" in some way. Appealing to only one party or ideology group will cause the average voter (species name: Voticus ignoramus) to fear that their vote will ""be wasted."" Of course, they don't see that voting for anyone already elected is ""wasting"" their vote because those already in power are parasites living off Our indifference.
2) Galvanize 350,000-425,000 voters: The average election in Puerto Rico has about an 85% turnout and that means about 1.8 million votes cast. Twenty percent of that number is 360,000, a substantial number that will cause all Fools to take the voter movement extremely seriously. Especially when the movement focuses on point 3...
3) Taking out entrenched Fools: There are folks in Our government that have the morals of an opium fiend with the willies, the ethical standards of a child-molesting priest and the intellectual development of week-old gumbo. Yet these scumbuckets are making decisions about Our economy (crashing), Our education (crashed), Our taxes (crushing) and thus Our future (crushed.) For that privilege, We are paying many of them salary and benefit packages that are simply ridiculous when compared to Our averages: mayors making over $100,000 a year, legislators making over $110,000, Cabinet officials over $190,000 and even support staff is making over $80,000. And what about consultants making over $125,000 on each of two or three ""legitimate"" contracts?
By attacking the incumbents, the voter movement automatically becomes one ""of change, for change."" Rather than attack all the incumbents, a series of targets are selected, primarily from the legislature. (Folks, I don't capitalize words for institutions I don't have at least a modicum of respect.) To make the biggest change, targets from each major party are selected and the criteria are simple: Those holding key legislative positions (president, vicepresident, speaker of each chamber, etc.) and those with the longest incumbencies (long-term parasites.)
A quick scan means that media tumors and crap merchants like Jenniffer ""Gluttonny"" González and Tomás ""Mad Dog"" Rivera would be targeted alongside commonwealth party tapeworms like Antonio ""You Haven't Caught Me"" Fas and José ""I Look Up to Tapeworms"" Varela. As the statehood party currently controls the legislature, there will be more names from that party than from the other, but that's how these changes work: by targeting those who have the most to lose.
In that sense, all legislators elected ""by accumulation,"" i.e., not tied to any senatorial or representational district, are the best targets, for they are often """"""party leaders"""""" who use their """"widespread mandate"""""" to fuck Us. (Notice the absolute lack of quotation marks around fuck Us. Twice.)
Also amongst the targets are certain mayors, who have become entrenched to the point of idiocy. Two examples are Carlos ""I'm A Businessman Like the Mafia Is a Brotherhood"" Méndez, of Aguadilla and José ""City Hall Is My Closet"" Rodríguez, of Mayagüez. Why them? because they've been in that chair for over 12 years; their time is past, if it ever was.
The voter movement would focus on kicking out incumbents, targeting them with direct questions, deep analysis of their shortcomings and raising awareness of how utterly useless these high-profile, long-squatting pisspots are. Rather than trying to change the entire political system, the voter movement would narrow its focus to a true leverage position: shaking the foundation of the most ambitious and entrenched.
Nothing strikes more fear into the heart of a Fool--more so than an F.B.I. badge--than a voter group that the Fool cannot buy. A voter movement aimed at knocking off incumbents, that crosses party lines in order to make changes happen, is a powerful force: when that force is applied well, it makes change inevitable.
And once the voter movement proves its worth, it need only target other high-profile, long-squatting smegmacups to make them pay attention to Us. Because that's the whole point of this voter movement: to make the Fools understand that they work for Us and that We hold the power, not them.
A name? Okay, how about Junta Electoral Nacional Independiente Organizada: JENIO.
Yeah, I know that's ""Jenius"" in Spanish, but it does have a certain ring to it, dissonant yet affecting.
However, for populist appeal, We could go with Movimiento Pa' Fuera, the Get Out Movement.
I know, Brethren: the trilling rhythms of ""¡Pa' fuera, pa' la calle!"" are already ringing in your ears...
The Jenius Has Spoken.

The Essential Qualities to Seek Out in a Great HVAC Repair Service
In the modern world, we are very fortunate to have a lot of different types of conveniences that previous generations could have only dreamed about. One of the biggest advantages we have today is that we are able to enjoy plenty of heating and air conditioning. When you have these types of appliances in your home, you will find that it becomes very easy to maintain a consistent indoor temperature even as the weather outside turns nasty. Whether you live in a hot environment or one that is very cold, you can feel quite certain that there are going to be some easy ways to keep your home feeling perfect.
The comfort you’re able to enjoy in your home, though, will often be disturbed quite a bit whenever any kind of HVAC unit failure happens. Most people who encounter any kind of issue with their air conditioner or heater will not have the kind of technical knowledge necessary to handle the repairs entirely on their own.

2117,"Children of Bodom are still as bloodthirsty as they were 20 years ago; they proved that Tuesday night (March 25) when they stopped by the House of Blues for their Halo of Blood tour and nearly destroyed the venue. Metal fans young and old braved the cold weather to rock out with other metalheads. But before the show, frontman and guitarist Alexi Laiho talked about the tour and what's next for Bodom.
Are there any pre-show rituals you do to get pumped up before a show?
Alexi Laiho: I just warm with up with some guitar and listen to music...to stuff that gets me, like you said, pumped up.
Are there any specific band or songs you listen to before shows?
AL: It could be anything. Right now we're listening to Guns N Roses...'80s stuff is usually the best.
The band has been together for over 20 years. Did you guys ever think you would last this long and have such a dedicated following?
AL: Oh not at all. Well, I knew that I wanted to this for as long as I'm alive. Me and the drummer started the band when we were like 13 and 14 years old. So, obviously it took a while for us to get a record contract and stuff, but it's gotten so much bigger than I ever thought it would be. It's pretty awesome.
“Halo of Blood” is your latest album and fans are hungry for new music. When can we expect that from the band?
AL: We're still in the middle of touring, so we got a couple of more tours lined up. I think we got s*** lined up until this fall. After that I'm gonna start writing new stuff and see what happens, so basically next year we're gonna hit the studio in April maybe.
With so many albums and songs under your belt, where do you get inspiration for new songs?
AL: You know it's funny, the thing is I don't really know. When I start writing music I just kind of try to block everything out of my mind and try not to really think about anything. Usually, I can just get an idea, a melody, or a riff or anything out of the blue, just out of nowhere when doing [anything] – like driving a car or something. Or sometimes when I'm sitting down with a guitar kind of noodling around and it kind of starts from there. It differs, but obviously I listen to music all the time things that you hear. I just kind of absorb stuff without really thinking about it. I don't really know where it comes from, but I'm glad it still does.
Where are you guys headed once the North American tour is finished?
AL: Yeah, we got tons of European festivals before that. After this we're going to Finland for three weeks and then we do – it's kind of like around the world tour. We start off in Russia, we're supposed to do Ukraine too, and Turkey, Israel, Australia, a bunch of countries and Asia and stuff. And then we go to South America. So, it's basically it's two months of going all over the place. After that the European festivals and after that we have one more tour and we should be done.
Do you guys ever take a break? It sounds really hectic.
AL: It is really hectic (laughs), but that's the way we like it. That's really what the band is all about anyways, playing live and touring. We've been doing this since forever, since the first album, like 1998. Since then we've been on the road. Everybody still enjoys it; we love being on the road and just love playing live.
So, no partying for you guys?
AL: Well, we do. Personally, I used to party like crazy every night, but the thing is I'm not 25 anymore. I;m taking it pretty easy when I'm on the road. Trying to make sure that I'm not all f***ed up and hung over when I hit the stage. I used to be able to do it, but I'm getting old so I gotta take it easy. I'll do my partying when I go back home.
Later that night, the venue buzzed with excitement as fans waited for Bodom to come on stage. When they finally did, the cheers were loud enough to bring down the walls. The band opened with their slaying hit “Sixpounder,” which got everyone in the crowd shouting “666!” The excitement in the room kept building as the band knocked out classics “Living Dead Beat,” “Halo of Blood,” “Bodom Beach Terror,” and “Hate Crew Deathroll.” They made sure to please everyone by doing old fan favorites along with tracks from their latest album. Occasionally, they would stop to thank Chicago for coming out or reminiscence about when they started playing in city back in 2003. They even treated fans to quick covers of the “Beverly Hills Cop” theme song, which got everyone clapping along.
Laiho pulled off intricate solos with ease, making it look simple. And keyboardist Janne Warman's playing is so unreal he looked like he was making the keys play by sheer willpower. Some of the songs that got the biggest cheers were “Are You Dead Yet?” which opened a massive circle pit in the crowd. When they signed off before their encore, a chant of “Bodom! Bodom! Bodom!” erupted. The final song of the night was the explosive “In Your Face.” Fans went nuts as moshing, jumping, and crowd surfing broke out. Onstage the guys seemed to revel in the adrenaline as Laiho leaped across the stage and even spinning his guitar around his body. Bodom left the crowd in bruises and aches, but most fans will agree it was well worth it. Children of Bodom is a metal act you don't want to miss.
Children of Bodom are currently finishing up their North American tour. Their last two shows are in New York March 28-29. Their latest album ""Halo of Blood"" is out now.

651,"Perrysburg resident to appear in March issue of Teen Vogue
Perrysburg resident Jordan Conrad, a senior at Notre Dame Academy in Toledo, has been named a Teen Role Model and a “fresh face” for designer Paul Frank's spring campaign.
Her prizes included a photo shoot wearing Paul Frank designs that will appear in the March issue of Teen Vogue, along with trips to California for the photo shoot and to the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in New York City this month.
Her entry addressed why she is a good role model for others.
“I try to make a difference by mentoring peers, tutoring after school, and volunteering as much as possible. I don’t drink or go to parties,” explained Ms. Conrad. It was one of five selected from over 1,000 essays. The final selection was based on a Skype interview.
Paul Frank is an American cartoonist, artist, and fashion designer. His creations adorn clothing, accessories, and many other products. Julius the Monkey is one of his best known-characters, and has appeared in a variety of media. Ms. Conrad describes Paul Frank as “unique, creative, and fun.”
At Notre Dame, Ms. Conrad is a role model and leader in multiple ways. She is a member of Link Crew, a group of primarily seniors who mentor freshmen. She was captain of the cross country team and encourages everyone to do their best. Despite not ever having played lacrosse, she went out for the sport her junior year. She made the junior varsity team, but moved up to varsity by the end of the season. She brings spirit to school as a member of Pep Club. She is very involved in social justice issues as part of the Social Justice Alliance and Students Equipped to Advocate for Life Team.
She has volunteered for Make-A-Wish since she was in eighth grade, helping with the holiday party and working with children at their yearly race. She has also volunteered at the Salvation Army and helped at the St. Rose Vacation Bible School.
She is an honor student taking Advanced Placement courses.
While on her recent trips to California and New York for the role model contest, she experienced marketing first hand and plans to make it one of her majors in college at John Carroll University next fall.",What prizes did Jordan Conrad receive for being named a Teen Role Model and a “fresh face” for designer Paul Frank's spring campaign?,"Jordan Conrad's prizes included a photo shoot wearing Paul Frank designs that will appear in the March issue of Teen Vogue, along with trips to California for the photo shoot and to the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in New York City."
1723,"Well, gosh, Love and Other Demons was certainly an experience. Not one we particularly enjoyed, alas. Although the weather was kind and our picnic was fun. To my mind, it was all rather dull with a simple recitative used throughout instead of any chance at lyricism (which I would have thought the book would encourage). I've never been so relieved to see the descent of a curtain. Though the singers were grand, I have to say, and of course it's always good to see a red-haired woman as the main character, naturally - it's just that the material they had to work with seemed poor. As Lord H commented as we left, they took the best bits of a very difficult book, so good on the lyricist and composer for that - but what they should have done to convey the power and passion of the themes was to give the South American flavour by using the rhythms and songs of that country, and to contrast this with the Catholicism sections by using religious chant as a counterpoint. Now that's an opera we'd have liked to see - but unfortunately this attempt ain't it. Perhaps some other composer could have a go?...
Oh, and my shoes were agony too - it was a relief to wrench them off when we got home!
This morning, the lovely Jeffrey Round has emailed me to say the following about Maloney's Law:
“A lovely book! Your poetic instincts were obvious from the start. I can always tell a real writer from a storyteller ... And gosh, but Dominic was a sexy bugger! Why is it always the immoral ones who are soooo good?????” [I've removed the middle sentence which gives away plot]
Thanks so much, Jeffrey - that's very much appreciated indeed! So glad you enjoyed the read. Also glad you liked Dominic - some don't! Of course, I think he's a sexy cad, but I would say that, wouldn't I?...
Today I have sorted out the cars so we have enough oil and water and tyre pressures for the week (hurrah!) and I have stirred myself to domesticity by baking a peach crumble. Which worked - double hurrah! This time, I added fruit juice to it so it wasn't so dry and we had the cream left over from yesterday to use up too, which helped. The peaches were perfect as well - I swiped one or two pieces (well, more actually) for myself whilst cutting them up. Mmmm, lovely.
And I've finished reading the hugely talented Vicki Tyley's Sleight Malice. A grand read, Vicki - I do hope they will be in the shops soon for you. I particularly loved the Desley & Fergus arc - they rocked. I've now started Vicki's Brittle Shadows and am loving Jemma too. I do enjoy a good action heroine!
Tonight, I have the repeat of Midsomer Murders in my sights for an evening's TV slump - ooh, and we've managed to watch our video of the last of the Bonekickers episodes. How I'm going to miss the gang! I hope they make another series - I do so love the main character, Gillian. Favourite character scene: the one where the great G rushes away from a kiss with the male totty as she's seen something more exciting and relevant to her mission on the telly - hurrah for Woman Power! It's good to see a gal who isn't afraid not to be nice. Bring it on! Wimpy heroines are soooo last century ...

Hi Anne, apologies but I'm going to have to disagree with you about Bonekickers, I thought it was terrible. Glad to see you're becming a domestic goddess with the peach crumble, I never seem to find the energy these days to want to actually cook. lol!
Shame on you, it's great!

Peach crumble sounds delicious - with or without the cream!
Mmm, it was - and there's more for tonight too!

[[WMG:Heroes are repurposed civilians]]
* Heroes aren't built completely from scratch. Most villains canonically started out as something different, so it's possibly that Heroes are civilian workers that, either voluntarily or otherwise, have been reworked into a body more suitable for crimefighting and world-saving and whatnot. Sure, there are mentions of Heroes being built ""from scratch"", but it's implied that the Assembly Tower is how Mak Megahertz ""recovered"" from being de-atomized.
[[WMG: Rocka is really a female pretending to be a guy]]
There were no females in the 3.0 wave. Maybe she wants to avoid attention from Furno.
* Or the glass ceiling.
* This is now [[{{Tropers/MorttheGhost}} my]] new headcanon.
[[WMG: My predictions for 5.0]]
* Von Nebula will be back, and with a new set.
* The heroes will have a different build entirely from the 2.0-4.0 ones, and bring back gear functions.
* William Furno will be rebuilt into a draconic form, and Rocka into a literal lion.
* There will be a new female.
* More vehicles.
** Assuming you're talking about the Brain Attack series, most of these things are jossed. Exceptions include part of your second point and your fifth point, because gear functions are present in the Jet Rocka set, which can also be considered a vehicle. Action features are also present in several of the other sets this wave, though none of the sets but Jet Rocka use gears for this purpose, and all of the sets with action features are still largely based on the traditional 2.0 build.
[[WMG: There will be an official cross-over with Bionicle in the near-future]]
* The reason all these ""Bring Bionicle Back"" campains and petitions are failing is actually because Lego is secretly planning to actually re-release Bionicle-themed sets as part of a secret cross-over with Hero Factory. Lego is fully aware of the large fandom of Bionicle; and the reason they ""discontinued"" Bionicle was to move the sights over to a terraformed astroid not far from Spherus Magna so they can ""expand"" the story. This is especially notable in the 4.0 series, where we are introduced to Black Phantom. The reason we don't get a backstory is because it's shocking: [[spoiler:Black Phantom is actually Makuta Teridax, who somehow survived the destruction of the Great Spirit Robot and was captured by Hero Factory.]] He even gets into the depths of the factory at the end of the 4.0 arc, and following that, [[spoiler:the Toa team up with the Heroes to defeat Teridax once more.]] The reason Lego did not tell anyone is simple. It's a suprise.
** {{Jossed}}. Greg Farshtey, writer of the BIONICLE and Hero Factory books and comics, stated [[ here]] that there will never be a BIONICLE and Hero Factory crossover because they do not exist in the same time continuum, just as the real world and the BIONICLE universe would never interact in canon story media.",What is the speculated reason for the discontinuation of Bionicle-themed sets according to the context?,The speculated reason for the discontinuation of Bionicle-themed sets is that Lego is secretly planning to re-release Bionicle-themed sets as part of a secret cross-over with Hero Factory.
264,"For those who know me, I've always been a horrible klutz, running into things, breaking things, burning things, etc. But I think because I'm pregnant, I've somehow been on an all-time high with the destruction. In the last past week, I've broken and burned so many things. Maybe I shouldn't blame this on being pregnant, but maybe its the increase of hormones is just causing an influx of klutziness.
Last Monday I was carrying 5 hard cider bottles out of the cooler (and don't worry I was not drinking any of them, sadly) I had too many in my hand, and I dropped one, spilling sticky hard cider all over the place.
Last Tuesday when making pies, I burned my arm, I guess when I was taking the pie out of the over, I hit my arm on the inside of the hot oven, and left a lovely burn mark on my arm.
Last Wednesday, when putting the dirty dished away, I had two our of dinner serving dishes in my hand at the same time, clung them together, and broken one.
Last Friday, in the middle of the night when going to the bathroom, and then I went back to bed, because it was dark and I was half asleep, I walked right into the bedpost, ramming my thigh in it, leaving a lovely giant bruise on it.
Last Saturday, when mopping the kitchen floor, I had the mop in the bucket, I moved the bucket, and the mop became top-heavy, and fell over knocking the entire contents of water all over the floor. So I start cleaning up the big mess, and this story even gets better. I hear dripping sounds of water in the basement, so I go downstairs to realize that the water leaked through the kitchen floor into the basement! Lovely. So I had two watery messes to clean up, and thank God the water didn't leak a few inches closer to all over Matt's electrical wires and electronic equipment.
Yesterday, I was making lunch at work, I had a hot frozen meal that I took out of the microwave, I opened the vent up to stir it, and don't ask me how, but somehow I manage to fling half of the contents of my frozen meal on to the floor, and on my hand, and the scorching hot gravy left a wonderful burn spot on my hand.
And today, literally just an half hour ago, I had Matt's glass he got from prom one year, he had coins in it. I took the glass with me to work, to put the coins in a penny competition we are having at work, and tonight I took the empty glass back out of my car. A smart person would have put all the coins in a bag and not even bring the glass along, but unfortunately I do not think smart like that. So when I went to grab the glass, I also grabbed my pie plate I had in the car, I put the pie plate on top of the glass, because I had too much in my hand, and of course I break Matt's prom glass. Good job me! Matt's not too happy with me right now, with my streak of destruction, which I can't blame him. :(
Maybe I shouldn't blame the increase of hormones, but maybe the increase of pregnancy brain, making me more flighty and just not thinking in the best way, and hence doing way more stupider things. Sigh. I'm getting worry about this destruction streak I've been having in the last week. I really hope it goes away, for the sake of my baby and my husband's sanity.
Knock on wood, I really really REALLY hope I don't break anything else this week or hurt myself in any way. I don't think I can go on for another 23 weeks of breaking things and ruining things..",What incidents of clumsiness does the narrator describe happening over the past week?,"The narrator describes several incidents of clumsiness over the past week.

194,"That's what I'm calling it.
This stomach virus that crept into our home unawares on the very 2nd day of this new decade.
This horrible thing that has wreaked havoc on our bodies and minds.
It began it's strangle hold on Ashlyn and I.
About 2 hours apart nearly smack in the middle of the night.
Why does that happen?
Why can't the misery begin during the day when others are up, and you have others around to keep you company, or to check on you, or the noises of the house to distract you from the pain and to entertain you?
Why, oh why, in the night does the child come running to you from their bed, past the bathroom (mind you), to jolt you from your sound sleep to alert you to the fact that they are going to throw up.....which upon this said announcement....they promptly do.
On your carpet.
Splashing the side of your bed?
Why, in the 21st century, when scientists have enough information and knowledge available to them to sustain human life ON THE MOON......is there not one doctor who can explain to me why this phenomenon occurs???
And why can't they explain to you how to prevent it from spreading to every. single. member. of the family.
Washing hands does not work.
Washing every piece of fabric in boiling water does not work.
Cleaning every. single. surface that the sick ones have touched, licked, drank out of, peed on, thrown up on, slept on, walked on, or breathed on with disinfecting wipes and lysol spray does not work.
Quarantining the ill ones to one room in the house does not work.
Sanitizing all the tooth brushes does not work.
Come ON!
What's the big mystery here PEOPLE???
It's enough to send me racing to the brink of insanity.
And just when the first group is feeling better, getting back into the swing of things, and you've got the floors bleached and all the linens washed, folded, and put away.....
the next group starts up.....at bedtime, of course.
Out of the 8 of us, 5 have surrendered to its tortures.
All girls.
The boys have stood strong.
My husband was on the cusp of being broken by it's grip.
The evening following the attack on Ashlyn and I, he started feeling nauseous and had the cold sweats.
But fortunately for all of us, he held strong and didn't give in.
Last night, it turned it's cold fingers to our oldest son.
He did throw up once and has been slightly feverish and achy today, but that's it.
The only one who has gone completely unphased and has enjoyed the unusual routines of the last week is our youngest son.
We'll see.
I have no idea if we'll make it to church on Sunday.
This monster strikes unexpectedly.
Your stomach starts hurting just all-of-a-sudden.
You throw up once and feel better.
You can walk around and have conversation and feel like your out of the woods.
But as time goes on....the pain and nausea intensifies.
It peaks and comes to a head after about 12 hours wherewith you finally can collapse into sleep.
My youngest son wouldn't do well by that.
He can't even wake up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, much less be aware that he needs to get to the toilet to throw up!!
So I would have to have him on a sheet on the floor next to me all night long.
I would have to be able to hear him getting sick in time to roll him over to a pan or something before it goes all over him and the floor!!
It's exhausting.
I have been an emotional wreck all week.
I hate to hear my girls crying for me to make it stop.
Begging me for some medicine to make it better......or to make them throw up.
Listening to them gasping for air.
Ashlyn has had the hardest time with her Diabetes.
But that is for another post.
When I'm not so tired.
When I can see the humor in it all.
Right now, I'm just pondering why on earth this week?
We have laid plans for this year.
Good plans.
We're excited about what lies ahead.
Just as we open the door and step into some new beginnings....
SLAM!
Right on our faces!!
So, now we feel a few steps behind.....and it's just the first week.

I feel for you and I truly understand your pain. 7 out of the 8 of us got the flu one week before Christmas. One week before 3 family Christmas parties I was having at my home. I thought that I was going to go insane. My husband was the only one that made it without throwing up.

1579,"Fear of Succeeding week I mentioned that I accepted a position as the Director of Ministry for a local Baptist church (fcbc.church). The first week has been a whirlwind! It has been amazing, difficult, challenging, and exciting all in one!
The gifts and talents that I bring into the ministry here seem like they are complementary to the gifts and talents the other staff and elders have. After the first week it seems like an amazing fit!
A lot has happened this past week with the ministry. There have been some deliveries of benevolence funds to people, helping someone find a new job, helping people get food at a local food pantry, and working with local organizations to see if they would be a good fit in our building during the off-hours.
Then there are those items that I have been doing for many years in the business industry: writing training programs for ministry leaders as well as church-wide, doing needs analysis of ministries, and studying up on topics I know very little about (when I started in the coffee industry about 15 years ago I had no clue what coffee really was, the same holds true today with ministry).
I sat down over a couple days and created some training programs. They need work, but I think they are pretty decent programs.
Then fear set in.
Proverbs 18:3 – To answer before listening – that is folly and shame.
How much prayer and seeking of God’s face did I do before working on these? I honestly couldn’t remember!
I knew I had prayed at least a little bit, but I couldn’t honestly say that I was putting God first as I put together those programs.
I hope I didn’t just do something successful without bringing Christ into it!!!
I know that ministry is tough. The first week here has been full, but not tough. I am wondering if I am missing something.
But what IS tough is keeping Christ at the forefront of the ministry.
Some tasks are simple. A door is broken, let’s get the door fixed. Not a lot of prayer time required to make sure I make the right decision.
But what about the benevolence and food pantry and job help. If I get those wrong, then more than my own ego would be in jeopardy. I honestly can’t remember how much prayer I put into them all.
Psalm 5:3 – In the morning, LORD, you hear my voice; in the morning, I lay my requests before you and wait expectantly.
So today I started something a little different. Instead of coming in and immediately getting to work, I am taking the opportunity to dig into the Bible for a few minutes and then go to prayer. Then, when I am about an hour or so from leaving, I go into the sanctuary and pray.
This is the reason that ministry is a calling and not a job. It is very easy to get caught up in the job aspects of the ministry, but if we look at everything as some aspect of “the job,” then we will never grow and excel in Christian ministry. But, on the flip side of that, if we spend all our time in prayer, fasting and dying to ourselves, then the little details like taking out the trash, setting mouse traps, and cleaning toilets will never get done.
1 Thessalonians 2:12 – Encouraging, comforting and urging you to live lives worthy of God, who calls you into his kingdom and glory.
I have had several jobs in my life. Every single one of them eventually gets boring and repetitive. I am sure ministry will be no different in many ways. But the call of ministry, if we see it as such, will carry us through the doldrums and bring us into exciting high winds to fill our sails.
So here’s to hoping that I don’t see only success. Here is to hoping that I fail a little. Here is to hoping I don’t get bored on the repetitive tasks and am able to enjoy the diversity of ministry.
And here’s to hoping that this journey will bring the discomfort to me and my family that causes the awakening that God so sorely needs in this world today.",What new practice did the Director of Ministry start to ensure he keeps Christ at the forefront of his ministry?,"Instead of coming in and immediately getting to work, he started taking the opportunity to dig into the Bible for a few minutes and then go to prayer.

This is the first time Heifer Philippines will be implementing a dairy project, just knowing that 1,000 original families will benefit from this deepens our dedication to explore, learn and apply best practices from successful dairy practitioners, Heifer Philippines Country Director Herc Paradiang said.
On May 1, 2013, a team from Heifer visited Toreja Dairy Multiplier Farm in Ibaan, Batangas, owned by Arnel and Dr. Eileen Toreja. Starting in July 2012 with 78 cattle from the National Dairy Authority, the farm now has 126 cattle. The visiting team included Asia/South Pacific Program Officer Dilip Bhandari, Heifer Philippines Senior Program Manager for the Field Lyndell Tagle, and Regional Program Manager for Southern Philippines Jun Ayensa. They discussed the availability of animal stocks in the Philippines over the next 10 years with the farm owners.
Next, the team visited the Batangas Dairy Cooperative (BADACO), a large-scale dairy multiplier farm focusing on cattle. The team visited both the dairy farm and the processing plant, where 25 $25,000 state-of-the-art automated dairy machines were recently set up. Edwin Sanchez, general manager of BADACO, talked with the visitors about the cooperatives plans for further expansion.
The last stop was St. Elmos Farm, a dairy goat farm in Nasugbo, Batangas. Owner Elmer Rivera shared with the team the daily farm operation process. The 4.9-acre farm has an average production of about 265 pounds of goat milk per day. He said that dairy as an enterprise is very promising, since there are very few players in the market and the demand for milk is very high and has grown continuously over the years.
At the end of the visits, Jun Ayensa said, The study visit has shared new insights for us. Through the lessons learned we can further improve our project design and implementation. It really shortened the learning curve, having seen it firsthand how the entire dairy process works.
Learn how you can support families around the world.",What is the purpose of the Heifer team's visit to various dairy farms in the Philippines?,"The purpose of the Heifer team's visit to various dairy farms in the Philippines is to better prepare them to design and implement a dairy project that will ensure success for at least 1,000 beneficiary families."

1876,"E-commerce surge poised to benefit small, independent retailers
August 10, 2021
South African consumers are heading online in greater numbers as the e-commerce shopping experience increasingly offers more choice and convenience than can be found at traditional big-brand, brick-and-mortar retailers, says Mike Farquharson, Managing Director of online courier aggregator Rush.
Statista market and consumer data projects that 31.6 million South Africans could be converted to online shopping by 2024. According to FNB, the average e-commerce spend already increased by 30 percent in the first half of 2020 compared to the year prior while Rand Merchant Bank expects the sector’s value to surge by 150 percent, to R225 billion, within the next five years. “These findings suggest that shifts in shopper behaviour towards online stores are becoming more permanent as consumers elect to spend at smaller, independent retailers for niche products, first rate service, and quick delivery,” notes Farquharson.
He says that thanks to game-changing technologies which have revolutionised logistics and supply chains the world over, independent retailers can compete with their larger peers in ways that weren’t possible just a few short years ago. “Along with advances in technology, more informed and sceptical consumers are holding retailers to higher standards. Small, e-commerce sites have a distinct advantage in that they can harness shopper loyalty through total customer-centricity and excellent service levels throughout the customer journey, including the all-important delivery ‘last-mile’.”
That consumers have access to more options and unprecedented amounts of information at their fingertips is well known. Farquharson says this makes getting the basics right very important. “An e-commerce business’ success depends upon speedy and proper delivery of products. The Rush platform allows online retailers to find a reputable, cost effective courier partner within seconds. Thanks to monumental changes in the sector, e-commerce deliveries have evolved from taking days or weeks to complete, to a day or even less.”
Farquharson adds that as large retailers grapple with how to nurture and retain customers, independent e-commerce players are leading the way with speedy, superior service. “The numbers prove that shoppers will trust an e-commerce site if they provide proper delivery of quality products. Rush ensures e-tailers have a choice of the best courier partners that are fast, safe, secure, and trustworthy. South Africa’s online retail sector shows real promise for long term growth potential, and the recent boom in online spending and adoption is great news for small South African businesses making a difference to our economy.”
Mike Farquharson, Managing Director of online courier aggregator Rush",What is the projected increase in the value of South Africa's e-commerce sector within the next five years according to Rand Merchant Bank?,"Rand Merchant Bank expects the sector’s value to surge by 150 percent, to R225 billion, within the next five years."
538,"Michael Phelps Workout, Daily Routine and Diet – Stunning Facts
Ok, can I just say how completely turned on I am by the way Michael Phelps has performed in the Rio Olympics! Every time he takes a dive, you know he’s going to end up with a medallion on his chest. The Olympics should perhaps be dedicated to him, like they were dedicated to Zeus in old times.
To get you a quick idea about how amazing, fit and absolutely mind-bogglingly stunning Michael Phelps is, check out this tweet.

Can you believe you share your lifespan with someone who has broken a 2168 years old world record?! What is it that makes Phelps so astoundingly awesome?
So what makes Michael?
The world was stunned when his performance in the Athens Olympics got him as many as 6 Gold medals. In Beijing, he scored 8, and in London in 2012, he scored another 4 gold medals! This time, Rio has seen him win 4 golds in the Olympics. And the question on everybody’s mind is, how does he do it?
Well, the answer isn’t exactly straight. What makes any athlete great? It is the constant commitment to excel at their sport, the perseverance to keep up the training even when you’re down in the dumps, the willpower to eat healthy even when it is your birthday and the all-you-can-eat-buffet is calling you with its delicious arms wide open. But even among the best of athletes, Michael Phelps is extra-ordinary.
At 31, Phelps is quite the exception to the usual swimmers career chart. Most swimmers make hay when they’re in their 20s, and retire out by the time 30 is around the corner. If not, their performance dips till it becomes unfeasible to continue the sport. Given the expensive nature of professional competitive swimming, where you need to keep your diet rich, get tons of exercise under a professional coach and how it is impossible to work an everyday job to pay for it all, with over 35 hours per week going into the training, it can be tough to follow the dream.
Phelps has help in the money front as well. And with the amount of sponsorship money that an everyday athlete can receive, it can certainly aid in the journey to be the best. Not many appreciate Michael’s shifty gait or see beyond a perceived clumsiness. But the man has quite a fan following across the world. From doing ads for popular brands like Omega, Subway and Speedos to the medals he wins by the pile every Olympic Games and in between, every bit of money and recognition serves to supercharge the athlete to give his absolute best.
Michael Phelps Body Structure
Swimmers know that not all athletes are born the same. Your body’s design, your height, even the amount of body hair can play a role in how quick you’re going to be in the pool. Michael Phelps is blessed in this department as well; his longer arms, shorter feet and double jointed knees serve him well. Some compare his feet to flippers, because they can turn a whopping 15 degrees more than the average human’s. And with the sort of workout regime Phelps follows, there is no chance of a race against Phelps being an easy battle.
Michael Phelps Workout Regime
Michael Phelps’ regime is pretty tough. Glance through it and you can see the amount of overwhelming detail. Michael Phelps’s workout shows you the amount of dedication you need to bring yourself to the level of readiness to win gold medals one after another. It’s no easy workout regime either.
Check out WorkOutInfoGuru to read the entire plan with extensive detail.
Michael Phelps Diet
Swimming can be pretty draining. Pushing your body through the water can be tough, and with Michael’s workout and zeal to beat the competition, his diet needs to be taken care of. You’ll be surprised how much this strapping hunk who’s fit like a greek god can guzzle down in just one meal. His calories? Phelps eats 12,000 calories per day! All the foods that you’re told to keep off of because you’re going to get fat, remember those? Phelps eats several portions of each of them. His fast body metabolism is only a small portion of his nutritional needs; Michael burns calories by the dozen!

There’s obviously not a lot of wisdom in mimicking someone’s workout plan unless a qualified trainer tells you to. But it does get you an idea about the level of dedication you need to have to excel at fitness. If you think you’re doing everything necessary to be the best in health and fitness, take it from Michael Phelps’s routine that there’s a scope for more. Your body is different, and so are your fitness goals. But if there’s one thing that fitness junkies must always pay attention to, it is to keeping up the motivation to be the best their bodies and minds can be.","How many gold medals did Michael Phelps win in the Athens, Beijing, London, and Rio Olympics respectively?","Michael Phelps won 6 gold medals in the Athens Olympics, 8 in Beijing, 4 in London, and 4 in the Rio Olympics."

Ryan Gosling is reported to be in negotiations to join the upcoming sequel of the sci-fi cult classic ""Blade Runner."" If he signs on, he will be joining Harrison Ford, who is reprising his role as Rick Deckard. Gosling's role, however, is still unknown.
Gosling, who was last seen in ""The Place Beyond the Pines,"" has been notably absent in box office hit movies this past few years. In 2013, he announced that he was taking a temporary break from acting, saying that he had ""lost perspective"" on what he was doing. During this time, he tried his hand at directing and producing. In 2014, he signed on for ""Nice Guys"" with Russell Crowe and is currently working on the ""The Big Short"" with Christian Bale, Steve Carrell and Brad Pitt.
Denis Villeneuve will helm the project for Alcon Entertainment, with the first movie's director, Ridley Scott as executive producer. The sequel's screenplay was written by Hampton Fancher and Michael Green. The story will still be set in a futuristic, dystopian Los Angeles, but several decades after.

Stiller also said that the next movie will be a ""giant bomb ... filled with money,"" hinting at the movie's possible success.
Stiller and his co-star, Owen Wilson, a month ago surprised the audience during the Valentino fashion show at Paris Fashion Week when both of them walked in the runway.

The sequel will bring back other cast members who were in the original movie, according to reports in Variety and Deadline. Apart from Billy Zane, Will Ferrell who played the sinister Jacobim Mugatu will also reprise his role and Christine Taylor as Matilda Jeffries.

What’s Russia’s response to the news that Donald Trump leaked classified information to Russian diplomats during a not-entirely-routine meeting? Mocking the American press.
The spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said she had received dozens of messages asking about the reports, which have been denied by the White House.
""Guys, have you been reading American newspapers again?"" [Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova] wrote on her Facebook page. ""You shouldn't read them. You can put them to various uses, but you shouldn't read them. Lately it's become not only harmful, but dangerous too.""
It's difficult to tell who's parroting who, here. The Russians were quick to jump aboard Trump's ""fake news"" declarations, but Trump's contempt for the press has been a longtime staple of Putin's government. Let's just say they're on the same page. Zakharova also specifically denied the White House shared such information, though that claim was strictly rendered obsolete by, well, Donald Trump.
If the foreign ministry is feeling cocky here, they have reason to be. A state-run Russian news outlet was the only press presence allowed into the Trump meeting, and they were quick to repay the favor by playing Trump for a rube.
It was actually Russian media, not U.S. media, that revealed that Trump’s meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also included Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak — reporting that, according to one official, made the White House “furious.” Despite the visual evidence, the White House has repeatedly avoided any confirmation that Kislyak was in the room.
Why the White House sensitivity? It's probably because conversations with Kislyak, specifically, were the things that got Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn fired, caused Attorney General Jeff Sessions to lie to Congress during his confirmation hearings, and are the subject of continued intelligence investigations. So, ya know … oops.

We’re repeatedly subjected to a lot of iPhone 7 rumors floating around the web featuring possible iPhone 7 features and design. But, out of all the speculations, what do we really want in our upcoming iPhone?
Image: Upcoming iPhone 7 Concept
The question keeps dangling in front of us without anyone bothering to address the situation. We do not wish to have our dreams to be shattered by buying Apple product like the iPhone 6 plus, which was hardly innovative. Or, do we?
Obviously, the issue is no longer a subject of customer dissatisfaction. Instead, it has become a major issue, which company needs to address with sheer focus if it wants to bounce back from a declining phase in the smartphone economy. Apple is already a mess in China. The country used to be the second largest market for iPhone, but the last year has witnessed a tremendous decline in the sales of iPhone.
Feature in Upcoming iPhone 7
The upcoming iPhone 7 needs to be a sure shot hit if the company wishes to win back the consumers, investors, and shareholders.
Also Read: iPhone 7 Release: The Decline of iOS Market Share Will Continue
So how would that happen? While Apple Inc. is going through a declining phase of iPhone sales, Google’s Android has established a strong hold in the international market. Apple CEO Tim Cook might need more than meager efforts for the upcoming iPhone 7 to beat the heat.
We went through numerous iPhone 7 rumors on the web and opinions offered by our team of researchers and writers who have surveyed Apple aficionados several times in past. Finally, we’ve come across a strong feature, which the next in line iPhone MUST carry. Only if it wants to win back the love from all over.
Water Resistance
Puh-lease! Dear Apple, we need this, badly indeed. One of the biggest causes of damage in our iPhone is water. Water damages lead to expensive repairs, and to be frank, we’re tired of flushing those ridiculous amounts of money. We’re investing heaps for buying your iPhone. The least you could do is offer some sort of protection from water. Imagine a girl trying to click a picture of her coffee to upload on Instagram. Somehow the mug flips and the entire content covers her iPhone. Moreover, she wipes off the coffee and discovers that her iPhone is dead. Disgusting and highly annoying! Galaxy S7, your fiercest competitor (as soon as iPhone 7 is launched) is priced at lesser amount compared to what iPhone 7 might be. But still the Android-based smartphone giant offers IP68 water resistance and dust resistance. It can be used in a pool, mud, rain, or steam baths. So, why can’t you, Apple?
Well, there are many other features too, which we would love to have in the upcoming iPhone 7. You can have a look at those features in our previous article.

Well bigger and bigger … But just the same old design is hardly innovative either right?
Let’s see something unique, useful and designed well which has some from another company. Oh look / it’s a projector in a phone – that works well…oh look this phone has an IRblaster… How useful … Or what wait they removed in the 3rd last model last year.
What are you waiting for from Apple? Can you not see whey are unique? Name another company that can replicate what Apple have, without droning on about iSheep?
The IOS market is not in decline. It’s growing. Perhaps Android is growing slightly faster, but to say The IOS market ‘is in decline’ is simply untrue.",What is a strongly desired feature for the upcoming iPhone 7 according to the context?,Water resistance is a strongly desired feature for the upcoming iPhone 7.
271,"Who steals from public television anyway? Apparently Erik Paulsen
Erik Paulsen just can't seem to keep himself out of trouble these days. Only recently was his party accused of darkening the skin color of his opponent, and now Twin Cities Public Television (TPT) is claiming Paulsen pirated its footage to advance his campaign..
As a non-partisan station, TPT ""has never consented to use of our copyrighted materials by any political candidate or party,"" the organization wrote in a press release.
In previous campaigns, we have requested that candidates - Democrats, Independents and Republicans - cease use of similar material, and all have complied...Twin Cities Public Television has sent two formal requests to the Paulsen campaign to remove all TPT footage from their ad; as of today, that request has not been honored.
We are therefore issuing this statement, taking appropriate legal action...
Oh, burn.
We would show you the ad, but TPT's tenacity has paid off. After notifying YouTube of the copyright violation, the website pulled down the ad. ""Since the Paulsen site was using an embedded version from YouTube, the ad was effectively removed from their site as well,"" says TPT spokesman Stephen Usery.
""Also,"" Usery adds. ""We discovered an anti-Paulsen posting on YouTube that included several snippets of video from Almanac. We requested that the person who posted the clips remove them and he did so immediately.""
Oh, double burn.

902,"Teddy bears have been having picnics for decades. It’s true. In fact, back in 1932, Jimmy Kennedy wrote the lyrics to the popular song we know today as Teddy Bear’s Picnic. It’s written to an amazing melody if you listen closely. There’s a lot of history to cute stuffed animals having picnics! There’s also hundreds of versions of the song, we especially like this one by Bing Crosby. There’s even a kid friendly cartoon version but if you share with kids, be sure to use SafeShare.tv!
With Teddy Bear Picnic Day officially being, July 10th we decided to have some fun and create a special MyPlate themed Teddy Bear Picnic Activity Guide. Fresh Baby’s special MyPlate Teddy Bear Picnic Activity Guide is perfect for Head Start, Early Head Start, pre-K, play group and day care lesson planning. The activities are adaptable but the main objective is to teach the children about the MyPlate food groups, healthy food choices and staying active!
Activity 1: Teddy Bear Color Math & Counting Using Fresh Baby’s 5-Section MyPlate
Objective: The children will learn the 5 MyPlate Food Groups.
Have the children color and/or cut out bears for each of the five MyPlate food groups, using our free teddy bear worksheet, available in black & white and color. Have the children match the bears with the Fresh Baby 5-Section Plate or a print out of the five MyPlate food groups.
Red bear = fruits
Green bear = vegetables
Purple bear = meat, eggs, fish or beans
Orange bear = whole grains, tortillas, rice, pasta or bread
Blue bear = milk, yogurt or cheese
Have the children match the bears with the colors of the plate. Discuss the different sections of the plate and the pictures. The idea is to help the children become familiar with the MyPlate food groups for eating a well-balanced diet, while also learning their colors and practicing counting.
Tip: Provide parents information on the MyPlate daily food groups and share with them our free Must Have Picnic Items tip sheet.
Activity 2: Feed Mr. Bear a MyPlate Meal
Objective: The children will learn the five MyPlate Food Groups.
During whole group time, talk to the children about the different MyPlate food groups. You can use a photo or the Fresh Baby 5-Section MyPlate. After you’ve discussed the different MyPlate food groups, tell the children you need their help to feed a very hungry Mr. Bear!
Using a stuffed teddy bear and pretend play food, ask the children, one-by-one to choose a food to help feed hungry Mr. Bear! If all the children are choosing fruits, encourage them to begin choosing the other food groups. Remind them that the bear needs a well-balanced meal! We can’t just feed Mr. Bear broccoli, for example.
Tip: You could use felt boards to choose the different foods and divide them by the MyPlate food groups or create a Velcro board.
Activity 3: MyPlate Bear Hop
Objective: The children will learn the importance of staying active.
This activity pairs well with the Feed Mr. Bear a MyPlate Meal, above. After Mr. Bear has eaten it’s time for him to get active and start moving! It’s similar to musical chairs and can make for a great transition game at the end of a whole group.
At the end of whole group, explain to the children why it’s important to stay active. Ask for their feedback on why we need to move our bodies. This is a great time to see what they know about physical activity and health!
Print and cut out our free large bear shaped paw worksheet, using the colors of the MyPlate food groups. You can print them on colored page, have the children color them or glue them onto colored construction paper. Laminate them and place them around the room.
Playing the tune of Teddy Bear Picnic have the children dance and move around the room. When you pause the music they must find a colored MyPlate bear shaped paw to freeze on. You can even quiz them and ask them to shout out what color MyPlate food group they’re standing on! For example, ask them to raise their hand if they’re standing on a red for fruits or green for vegetables.
The child who does not have a MyPlate colored bear paw, is out.
Tip: This is a great time for them to get ready for outdoor play or wash their hands and be dismissed for snack.
Activity 4: Make a Healthy MyPlate Teddy Bear Snack
Objective: The children will review the MyPlate food groups.
Its snack time and children love to help in the kitchen! This is a great activity that allows for the children to make their own snack and learn about the different food groups and which food group they’re eating from for their snack. See if they can spot which food group they’re not eating from!
Using whole grain bread, have the children spread peanut butter on the bread. Depending on the age, the adult may do this for them.
Have the children decorate their peanut butter bread with strawberries for the ears, bananas for the eyes and blueberries for the nose and mouth. If they get creative with this, that is okay. It’s the process, not the final product that matters!
Talk with them about what MyPlate food groups their snack foods belong in.
Serve with milk and don’t forget to ask them what MyPlate food group milk belongs in!
Tip: This is a great time to check their knowledge on the food groups and what they’ve learned or still need to learn.
Activity 5: Pack a MyPlate Picnic
Objective: For children to make healthy food choices and pack a healthy MyPlate picnic.
Using our free downloadable picnic basket coloring page, have the children tear or cut out photos of food from catalogs or magazines. This is a great fine motor activity!

Timeline
Following a takeover at Sheffield Wednesday by Thai businessman Dejphon Chansiri, Gray was sacked in the summer of 2015 and replaced by head coach Carlos Carvalhal.
Stuart Gray was appointed as head coach of Sheffield Wednesday following the 2–1 win over Rochdale in the FA Cup on 25 January 2014.
Earlier in that FA Cup run, Gray scored his only goal for Southampton, in a replay against Manchester United at Old Trafford. Micky Adams hit a probing left-foot pass which dropped between Peter Schmeichel and Paul Parker. Gray nipped between the goalkeeper and defender to stroke the ball home from just outside the area. Southampton eventually went on to win the game in a penalty shoot-out after scores were level 2–2 after extra time. This was the first ever such shoot-out involving First Division sides.
Following the departure of Dave Jones from Sheffield Wednesday at the end of November 2013 Gray took over as caretaker manager with a view to taking on the managerial role permanently, and as of 8 February had led Wednesday to a run of 11 unbeaten games in all competitions.
In his one full season in charge of the club, he secured their highest finish for 6 years, finishing 13th in a Championship campaign that also saw Wednesday equal their clean sheet record for a season.
In December 2012, Gray was hired by his former Southampton colleague, Dave Jones, as a member of the coaching staff at Championship club Sheffield Wednesday.
On 19 January 2010 Gray became the first-team coach for Burnley. On 30 December he was appointed caretaker manager following the departure of Brian Laws. Gray left Burnley on 13 May 2011 as part of a restructuring after the club failed to achieve even a play-off place in the season just ended. Gray became first-team coach at Portsmouth but was made redundant in April 2012 as part of cost cutting due to their financial difficulties.
Gray was sacked as Northampton Town Manager on 8 September 2009, following relegation from League 1 in the 2008–09 season and being 16th in League 2 after six games in the 2009–10 season.
On 2 January 2007, Gray was appointed as the manager of Northampton Town after accepting a 2 ⁄2 -year contract; he replaced John Gorman who had resigned on 20 December 2006.
When Hoddle was lured away to Tottenham Hotspur in March 2001, Gray initially took over as caretaker manager, before taking on the role permanently in June, as Southampton moved to their new St Mary's Stadium. Early results were poor and chairman Rupert Lowe panicked about the effect on the club's investment in the new stadium and Gray was sacked after little more than 3 months in charge, to be replaced by Gordon Strachan. During his brief tenure as manager, he broke Southampton's transfer record, signing Rory Delap for a fee of £4 million.
After his playing career was finished, Gray joined the coaching staff at The Dell before moving to Wolverhampton Wanderers in June 1994 as reserve team coach. His family were unable to settle in the West Midlands at this time, so he returned to Southampton, initially working in the community office, before becoming reserve team coach under Dave Jones in July 1997, moving up to first team coach in November 1998, a role he retained after the appointment of Glenn Hoddle as manager in January 2000.
Gray joined Southampton in September 1991 for a fee of £200,000 as one of Ian Branfoot's first signings. Initially, this appeared to be a useful signing for the club as he could play either at left-back as cover for Micky Adams or in midfield, but a serious Achilles tendon injury sustained in an FA Cup match against former club Bolton Wanderers ended his playing career.
Born in Withernsea, East Riding of Yorkshire, Gray began his professional career with Nottingham Forest, emerging from the youth system with players such as Steve Hodge and Colin Walsh. He joined Barnsley in 1984 and continued to build a reputation as a steady and versatile player, scoring 11 league goals in the 1986–87 season. He moved to Aston Villa in 1987 and won promotion the following year and runners-up in the First Division in 1990.
Stuart Gray (born 19 April 1960) is an English former professional footballer and manager. He has previously managed Southampton, Northampton Town and Sheffield Wednesday as well as working as caretaker manager for a number of teams.",What is the height of Stuart Gray?,Stuart Gray's height is 5′ 10″.
935,"The Foundry has been home to some of SMP's most stunning weddings. It's this gorgeous combination of industry and elegance and the fusion makes for a backdrop that basically cranks up the style notch of any style of wedding. Now with that said, we're pretty sure this celebration could hold its own against any canvas with a bride and groom that are all glowy and gorgeous, a style that is bohemian and full of love and a few little tidbits of total unabashed gorgeous. Photographed by Jenny Jimenez with stunning florals by Saipua, this wedding has love written all over it. Click here to see even more.
From the bride… Andrio and I have covered a lot of ground in our relationship. We met while both living in Seattle, started our relationship commuting between Philly and New York and finally got engaged on the same Manhattan rooftop where we shared our first kiss after I relocated to New York. We knew we wanted our wedding to be a celebration of the two of us and the things we hold most dear. With Andrio’s family near Portland, Oregon and mine from outside of Detroit, planning a wedding in either of our hometowns felt too far removed from the other’s roots. We opted to host the event in New York, our current hometown, and use it as an excuse to bring everyone together and give them a little taste of the things we love most about being New Yorkers.
Both of us being designers (Caroline is a textile designer in the fashion industry and Andrio is a graphic designer), we wanted to find a space that would allow us to put our own special spin on the look and feel of the day. We wanted an event that was intimate, casually sophisticated and filled with warm candlelight, wonderful wine and food. The venue also had to allow dogs, as we wanted our long-haired dachshund, Marlow, to act as ring-bearer for the ceremony (he literally dragged the flower girl down the aisle on the day of). When we discovered The Foundry in Long Island City, we knew we had found our spot. From the beginning we agreed to keep the color palette very simple — just shades of white, ivory and gray to soften the New York industrial interior of The Foundry with rustic elements to remind us of the Oregon Coast where Andy grew up vacationing and we have shared many happy trips to together.
Both of us coming from very close-knit families, Andy and I knew from the start that we wanted to create our reception menu to pair with wines from The Grade Cellars, a vineyard owned and operated by my uncle and aunt in Napa Valley. We were able to create a menu that perfectly complemented their wine by working with Shaun Roberts at Great Performances. Great Performances has a farm in upstate New York that they source a lot of their produce from. We were proud to be able to feature locally-gown produce in our wedding menu as well as food from other local vendors such as Van Leeuwen Ice Cream, Brooklyn Roasting Company Coffee and Tom Cat Bakery (which is actually located right across the street from The Foundry — talk about fresh bread!). Shaun also helped to include some additional personal items into the menu such as serving mini lumpia (a traditional Filipino snack since Andrio’s family is from the Philippines) during the cocktail hour as well as helping us recreate the famous Pecan Pie Sundae from Buttermilk Channel, our favorite Brooklyn restaurant. My father said that the only thing wrong with the wedding was that it ended too soon. Our wedding day was without question the best day of our lives and when I look at these images I am so happy to see that everyone had as good a time on our wedding day as we did.

973,"""Not Quite Spoleto""... Art Exhibit at Moultrie High School Class Reunion
The first ever ""Not Quite Spoleto""...Art Exhibit was held during the 2008 Moultrie High School Class Reunion at the historic Sullivan's Island home of Gene West (""Most Talented"" classmate and varsity football).
As Sparky Witte, Reunion Coordinator (""Wittiest"" classmate, tract team member) Linda West, Gwen West Wilson and other classmates renewed old friendships,
memories of Virginia Fouche Bolton, art teacher to many present were discussed.
In her memory, on the opening day of Spoleto Festival USA and Piccolo Spoleto, The ""Not Quite Spoleto"".. Art Exhibit was somewhat irreverently mounted to continue the tradition of showing fine art which she instilled.
A creative, sometimes hard driving teacher, Mrs. Bolton was an inspiration to her many students and a driving force for a lifetime of interest in the arts.
Classmates Kenny Barnes (MHS art club) and Dana Schneider (MHS band and Valedictorian, The High School of Charleston Class of '69) visit.
Kenny remembers the wildlife artwork he created and sold ""back in the day"". He told of the time Mrs. Bolton took him to meet Anne Worsham Richardson an accomplished Chas. painter and ornithologist, as an incentive to further his skills.
Mrs. Bolton organized an annual end of school sidewalk art show at Moultrie which provided her students with the opportunity to show and sell their student artwork.
The first Art Show I helped organize was a benefit to raise money for the Moultrie Art Club to visit the
National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC. That trip was the first chance many of us had to see great national artistic masterpieces in person.
Mrs. Bolton later taught art at other local schools and became an accomplished professional artist with a successful gallery in Charleston. Her paintings and fine art prints are still in great demand. ()
Joe (MHS band) and Sally Mansfield look over old newspaper articles at the exhibit.
Left to rt. Sissy Kirchner Seyle (""Best All Around""classmate, class treasurer, Hall of Fame), Katherine (Kay) Muschick Schneider (exhibiting artist, art club), and Dottie Benton Frank (best selling author and art club secretary).
Karin Tharin Lyons (girl's tract team), Lara Seabough Northcutt (cheerleader), and Lynn Ward (artist, cheerleader) enjoying the evening.
Paintings by Kay Muschick Schneider were on display among memorabilia of past Moultrie HS Art Shows.
Memories of creating art in the past lead to plans for former classmates to get together to paint in the future.
Mrs. Bolton would be pleased.
A ""Not Quite Spoleto""... Art Exhibit. Honoring the past. Facing the future.
If you have a memory or story about Mrs. Bolton to share It'd be great to hear about it here (click comments) .

Lots going on. Enjoy!
I was having such a big time yacking with my friends, I didn't get to see the show. How 'bout a post with some of the artwork?
I guess Mrs. Bolton would give me my usual grade for this - incomplete...
You and me both Geechee Boy. Remember the weekly homework? 10 pages of drawings in our sketch books ea week? And she'd initial every pg to make sure - yeah lots of incompletes on those. I remember drawing lots of bottles, too.
Hi y'all,
I remember the sketchbook drawing too.
It was hard figuring out what to draw to fill those 10 pages up ea week. Usually I drew whatever I could find in school: cafeteria food, pencils, books, whatever.
The first thing Mrs. B had our class draw were bottles. First a line down the middle. The rest was easy-just draw ea side the same. She had so many different kinds of bottles in the art room for us to draw, she got the nickname ""Bottles Bolton"".
But I did learn how to draw from life- not an easy thing to do, even now.
Geechee Boy- I'll see about getting some of the paintings from the ""show"" on the blog. Thanks for asking.
Kay
Thanks Kay. Great Pics. Your are so industrious. I'm still trying to get my web pages to work correctly.
I do remember those sketch pages each week. I loved art class. It never lasted long enough.
May 24th will be here in a blink of an eye..See ya soon,
Lynn
I agree, art class was my fav. part of day. And Mrs. Bolton was right - it's important to keep sketching from life.
Good luck with your web pages. Let's get together and paint soon.

1418,"THE HAUNTED PALACE: A Lovecraft In Poe’s Clothing
The Haunted Palace is often lumped in with Roger Corman’s cycle of Edgar Allan Poe adaptations for American International Pictures. That’s primarily the doing of A.I.P., who insisted on drawing the title from a Poe poem and opening and closing the film with a few quotes from said poem. However, the film actually finds Corman taking a brief break from Poe by adapting the H.P. Lovecraft novella “The Case Of Charles Dexter Ward.” The result isn’t that different from the approach of Corman’s Poe films but does offer some
interesting textural differences in storyline and style.
The Haunted Palace starts in a rousing fashion with an opening reel that depicts the villainy and burned-at-the-stake demise of Joseph Curwen (Vincent Price), a wicked sorcerer who puts a curse on the town of Arkham before he goes up in flames. Many years later, his descendant Charles Dexter Ward (Price again) inherits his mansion and travels to Arkham with his wife Ann (Debra Paget) to see it.
The townspeople are secretive and unfriendly, with the exception of kindly Dr. Willet (Frank Maxwell), but Ward presses on with his task. He soon discovers that the Curwen family bonds can have a supernatural power – and not only does Joseph want his old black magic resumed, he also wants revenge on the
descendents of the townspeople who executed him.
The results feel like Corman applying the gothic-shock approach he developed on his Poe films to Lovecraft material. Beaumont’s script is solidly plotted and weaves in clever references to a number of concepts from other Lovecraft tales (Arkham, the Necronomicon, etc.) but it drags a little during the midsection. Also, the state of special effects technology circa 1963 and the budget/schedule work against Corman’s attempts to portray Lovecraft’s eldritch horrors – one big creature effect during the finale falls noticeably flat – so Corman and Beaumont both devote more time to doing the kind of “old dark house” and undead spirit-type horrors from the Poe film
cycle.
That said, The Haunted Palace is a solid programmer if viewed on its own merits. Corman had a confident grasp of horror film technique by this point and shot the film entirely on sets to get a surreal, stylized look that is quite effective: the foggy Arkham streets and skeletal forest have a particularly striking look.
As usual, Daniel Haller’s impressive sets have the right sort of gothic grandeur and Floyd Crosby’s cinematography weaves wonders from shadows and fog. Ronald Stein composes the score here and achieves a doomy feel that is subtler than the Les Baxter scores from the early Poe films. Corman harnesses their talents and effectively and uses their work to craft some wonderful sequences, including the breathless opening reel and a great scene where Price and Paget are surrounded on the street by Arkham’s mutated citizens.
The Haunt
ed Palace also has one of the best casts for a Corman production of this era. The supporting cast is packed with a number of familiar faces, including Leo Gordon and Elisha Cook Jr. as important men in the town and a wonderful, subtly ominous turn from Lon Chaney Jr. as the caretaker of the Curwin house.
Paget is also compelling and sympathetic as Ward’s long-suffering wife. That said, it is Price’s show all the way: he gets to not only play a dual role as Curwen/Ward but also gets to portray Ward being possessed by Curwen. He handles the shifts of persona like a pro and brings a palpable sense of delight to Curwen’s wickedness.
In short, The Haunted Palace is a second-tier entry within the list of the Corman/Price collaborations… but that duo’s second-tier material is worth a lot of horror filmmakers’ first-tier material from the same era. If you enjoy their collaborations in the Poe arena, you’ll find this little sidetrip into Lovecraft territory worth taking.","Who are the main characters in the film ""The Haunted Palace"" and what roles do they play?","The main characters in the film ""The Haunted Palace"" are Joseph Curwen and Charles Dexter Ward, both played by Vincent Price. Curwen is a wicked sorcerer who is burned at the stake and puts a curse on the town of Arkham before his death. Many years later, his descendant Charles Dexter Ward inherits his mansion and travels to Arkham with his wife Ann, played by Debra Paget. The townspeople are secretive and unfriendly, except for Dr. Willet, played by Frank Maxwell. Ward discovers that the Curwen family bonds have a supernatural power and that Joseph wants his old black magic resumed and revenge on the descendants of the townspeople who executed him."

MULAT
AND
FLORIDATOWN-PACE
Another among the land grants that were important in the history of this area was the one made to Jacob Kelker. Kelker has been termed a mulatto, the son of a Spanish nobleman of Pensacola and his slave-woman. The grant was made obviously to get the man away from the city before the color line was drawn by the American authorities. Mr. Kelker died at ""Kelker's Field"" in 1827.
The bayou almost alongside his grant was called the ""Mulatto Bayou"" which by contraction today we call Mulat Bayou as well as the little village nearby, Mulat. It is altogether likely that Andrew Jackson knew of Kelker's settlement and was actually headed for there when, he is said to have camped at Floridatown. Probably the acquaintance existing between some of General Jackson's scouts and Kelker or others contributed to the choosing of this site. He, no doubt, spread out his encampment to include both, or a part of both, these areas in his camp. (in many ways, at least, the two adjacent areas were synonymous.) Again no doubt, there was information to be had there.
just when Floridatown began is rather vague. Some of the earlier maps locate it at its present location but name it simply Florida. That of course was the name given to the whole territory when named by Juan Ponce de Leon in 1513 - in honor of the season Pascua Florida. just when it assumed the combination is doubtfully vague.
Floridatown was, and is, located at the confluence of the delta of the Escambia River and Escambia Bay - an easy ""slack tide"" crossing of the Escambia. A bit of the earlier commerce of the area was transshipped there. Here too was the stop-over resting place of various expeditions of one kind or another as they traveled across what is now Santa Rosa County, whether the direction of travel was East-West or North-South.
It was there that Andrew Jackson sent a contingent of troops commanded by Major Uriah Blue. David (""Davy"") Crockett was a member of his Company, for ""Davy"" says in his autobiography that he ""went 'bar' hunting up the 'Scamby'."" In one of the Jackson expeditions was John Hunt of Huntsville,' Alabama, another important name in early Santa Rosa County history - and later as aforementioned to be one of the largest single landowners of this county. As a territorial county Floridatown became the county seat of Santa Rosa County, and was changed only when ""yellow jack"" (yellow fever) decimated the population in 1842.
It was there too that the first election was held in Santa Rosa County; James Spellenan's residence was the polling place. The first sheriff of Santa Rosa County (territorial), Jesse Carter Allen, served and lived at Floridatown until the county seat was moved to the site of Milton because of the yellow fever outbreak. W. W. Harrison, his successor, often used facilities at Floridatown.
The Pace half of this hyphenated name has a much different historical background than that of the Floridatown half of the hyphenation. It, of course, has had much of the same experience. The very proximity of one to the other would presume that.
The name Pace is that of the Pace family, of Virginia, so far as we have been able to determine. Thomas B. Pace and Catharine McCray Pace were the parents of James G. Pace whose wife was Carrie Ashley of a very prominent Valdosta, Georgia family engaged in the turpentine business. They moved from Georgia to Alabama and from there they later came to Pensacola, where they had acquired considerable timber holdings. The Skinner holdings of Gull Point were a part of such acquisitions.
James G. and Caroline Ashley Pace were the parents of four children: John C. Pace; H. Burgess Pace (graduate of the University of Georgia) who did much to develop the new Floridatown; Myrtice who married Mr. E. F. Stone; Ashley D. (A. D.) Pace now very much identified with Pace interests here and elsewhere.
Upon the death of Carrie Ashley Pace, James G. Pace was married to Winona Rabb. They were the parents of Mary Catherine who married W. W. Townsley; Virginia; James G. Pace, Jr.; Winona who died in 1938; and Frances who married W. R. Thompson.
Mr. J. G. Pace, Sr. died in 1948. At Pace the Pace Company engaged in sawmill and turpentine operations in a big way until the ""thirties."" Mr. Pace had long been an advocate of ""sustained yield"" lumbering operations and through his studies of that problem hit upon pulp production as the most satisfactory outlet for ""sustained yield"" lumbering.
He, James H. Allen, and others formed the Florida Pulp and Paper Company, as well as the Alabama Pulp and Paper Company. These two units were combined and then in 1942 became a part of the St. Regis Company (the second largest in the world.)
The sons of James G. Pace, Sr., especially John C. Pace, Harvey Burgess Pace, Ashley D. Pace, have made a great contribution to the economic, social, and political development of this community which bears their name.
The present school facilities at Pace (which serve Floridatown also) were begun as a permanent structure in 1925-26. At one period the school facilities were more than adequate, but a near-boom in the area has strained such facilities to well nigh the bursting point at all times during the recent years. Numerous additions to the old structure has enabled it to very well keep pace with the growing population. Now a junior high school is in use and no doubt it in turn will be followed soon by a senior high school.
Much of the ""boom type"" growth has been due to the location in the area of Escambia Chemical Company, manufacturer of chemicals from natural gas; and American Cyanamid Company, manufacturer of creslan, a new and better synthetic fiber.
The growth in these areas has been matched by the growth in religious facilities which has found the establishment of representative congregations and buildings to match those of the areas in the county outside of Floridatown-Pace.
Back to King History Table of Contents",Who was Jacob Kelker and why was a land grant given to him?,"Jacob Kelker was termed a mulatto, the son of a Spanish nobleman of Pensacola and his slave-woman. The land grant was given to him to get him away from the city before the color line was drawn by the American authorities."
2296,"Proverbs chapter 14 is similar to most of the rest of Proverbs. It consists of short, pithy statements that stand alone. Chapter 14 continues the long contrast between wisdom and folly. In verse 22, God asks a rhetorical question that contains the obvious and expected answer within the question itself. It goes like this, “Do not those who plot evil go astray? But those who plan what is good find love and faithfulness.” (NIV) Few of the proverbs are presented in the form of a question; most which are presented as a question, are like this one, done so for emphasis. God does not want us to miss the point. He is in effect saying, “Make no mistake about it, this is no gamble, it is a sure thing”.
The two verbs “plot” and “plan” in verse 22 are exactly the same word in the original Hebrew. We know many people who seem to simply wind up doing evil, without a plan to do it. They are simply weak or ignorant or foolish. Others we know seem to spend much time and energy plotting evil. Verse 22 indicates that those who plot evil will certainly go astray. The idea of going astray brings Isaiah 53 to mind: we have all like sheep gone astray, turning to our own way. Jesus tells us in John 14 that He is “The Way” and that it is impossible to get to heaven without coming through Him. Plotting evil will cause you to go astray and miss “The Way”. My advice is to heed the warning.
I come into regular contact with people who are plotting evil; if personal experience is not enough evidence, all I have to do is take a quick glance at the newspaper and I have more than enough examples. Please do not imagine that this is limited to the heinous crimes that we see in others. It is most certainly also our plotting to: cheat our employer out of a full day’s work; hide assets of loved one’s so that the government will pay their bills; draw unemployment checks when we could work; apply for disability when we could do some kind of work; gossip (which is often designed to hurt someone); making others appear in an unfavorable light to make ourselves look better; etc. and etc. Maybe I did not list your problem, but that’s not necessary; you can add that one to the list yourself. It would be a great benefit to our own selves if we would take a long, close look at our plots and plans. The consequences are significant whether we do or don’t.
The second half of verse 22 presents an emphatic contrast. Those who plot and plan what is good will surely find love and faithfulness. An alternate and legitimate translation could say that those who plot and plan what is good will display love and faithfulness. Mercy, kindness, and truth have also been used to describe the result of planning what is good. Just as we know people who seem to commit evil without trying, we also know those who seem to do good without really planning it, if it sneaks up on them, if the opportunity just appears before them. Have you ever stopped to consider what would happen in the world around you if you actually spent time planning and plotting good? I can barely imagine how the world would change if a majority of people tried that. We would both give and receive love, faithfulness, mercy, truth, and kindness. What a blessed and glorious)",What does Proverbs chapter 14 verse 22 suggest about those who plot evil and those who plan good?,"Proverbs chapter 14 verse 22 suggests that those who plot evil will certainly go astray, while those who plot and plan what is good will surely find love and faithfulness."
1234,"Prejudice in America Has Re-Awakened Anti-Semitism
Kahntentions
Gilbert N. Kahn is a professor of Political Science at Kean University.
There is an underlying tension which has filled America since the 2016 presidential campaign but has been present since at least the 2008 election of Barack Obama. The long, ugly history of American racism has reappeared and grown. As some analysts have observed, much of the not articulated opposition to Obama emanated from deep-seated hostility towards African Americans or rejection of the thought of a Black American president. What the Trump campaign did was to exploit this pent-up anti-Black feeling among many Americans. (Trump also buttressed this same group’s belief that America should not be governed by a woman.)
In Donald Trump these Americans had a candidate and then a President who saw America as they did; a country that was becoming too Black and too Brown. It is not only Trump’s style and bullying to which they gravitated, but it is also his pro-white message. These basic prejudices which are part of American history were blatantly and brilliantly exposed on television in the 1970’s by Archie Bunker and All in the Family. Trump successfully brought back all this ugliness in America, that had been latent for an entire generation. It gave his supporters license to express their feelings.
In addition to these prejudices, plus sexism and homophobia, the past 18 months have seen a normalization in America of anti-Semitism which had not been present for decades. The proliferation of candidates for office who have espoused anti-Semitism keeps increasing. Only last week, in a race for the Missouri State House, Steve West was selected as the Republican nominee. In discussing Jews on his radio show last year West had stated that: “Looking back in history, unfortunately, Hitler was right about what was taking place in Germany.” The State Republican Party has disassociated themselves from him and his views, but West won the nomination handily.
Most of the major television and cable channels have carried stories on the growing anti-Semitism in this mid-term election cycle. The problem, however, is two-fold. First, it confirms that the anti-Semites have re-emerged along with the other prejudices. There is clearly an audience and a market for these candidates. Together with all the other hatred and bigotry that has been present over the past few years, being anti-Semitic once again is acceptable to many people.
Second, there are already anti-Semitic candidates on the ballot in the November elections. While these candidates are largely Republicans, it is unlikely that any party would tell its supporters to vote for the candidate of the other party. They may repudiate the candidate, but they will not take the step to prevent their candidate from a possible victory.
In addition, it is important to recognize that state and county parties recruit and cultivate candidates to run for electoral office. It ought to be the mandate of all parties to prevent any candidates who espouse prejudices and biases to be nominated. They clearly should be opposed by all parties party in such an effective manner –including with funding–that they are unable to win a nomination.
Finally, with the growth of anti-Semitism which has been manifested in this year’s mid-terms, there is a segment of the American people who accept and even encourage it. Anti-Semitism like other prejudices has risen up again. This is dangerous and scary, and will not end well.",Who is Gilbert N. Kahn and what is his profession?,Gilbert N.

Molina .","What was the score of the game between BOS and TOR on Tuesday, May 10, 2011?",The score was 7-6.
958,"This is about loading a quilt on a longarm quilting machine. If a quilt top is floated, it is basted at the top of the quilt and the bottom is flapping loose. That is, the quilt top is not attached to a zipper, roller or the backing until the quilt has been quilted and advanced to the bottom. Here is picture of a floated quilt.
Good practices:If you are going to sew, use your clamps. Clamps are attached to the backing only. The backing should not pull severely when clamped.
Terminology: ( you said you only have 3 rollers so you do not have a leveling roller)
Take-Up roller is at the back of the machine. It is the one ""inside"" the throat of the machine. Your quilt backing
will be zipped onto this roller. Your entire quilt will be 'taken up' on this roller
Belly roller is the one that touches your belly from the front of the machine. The bottom of your quilt backing will be rolled onto this roller.
The middle roller will hold the zippered bottom of the quilt top unless you float your quilt.
Full float means no zippers are used on the quilt top.
Zippers.... you will love them once you get the procedure down.
I float my quilt top so I don't use the zipper marked ""quiltop bottom left"". Before I began floating my quilts, I would baste (or pin) the bottom of the quilt top to the third zipper half also using my Domestic Sewing Machin (DSM).
Then I carry the pieces to my longarm.
-Zip the backing onto the take-up and belly rollers (top and bottom)
-Roll the backing onto the belly roller smoothing out puckers and wrinkles. Leave some slack in backing. The back-side of the backing should be face up.
- Zip the bottom of the quilt top onto the middle roller. Roll it completely onto the roller to keep it out of the way for now. (Skip this step for a full float).
-Place the batting on top of the quilt backing as close to the top of the backing as you can get it. You may want to pin it every 6"". You will be basting this batting on so do not pin close to the top. With the top of the batting pinned to the top of the of the backing, smooth the batting along the width of the quilt and finesse the batting between the middle roller and the belly roller. Smooth it gently. The batting (and quilt top if floated) drapes over the belly roller and falls to the floor (depending on length; it is loose).
Tighten the belly roller carefully smoothing the batting on top too and set the brake (right front) on the belly roller. Do not make this tight or you will break thread when you quilt. You're not supposed to be able to bounce a quarter off the quilt
-Slowly baste the batting to the backing. Remove the pins from the batting/backing. Release the brake.
- Lay the quilt top (pretty side up) (unroll from the middle roller if you used zipper) carefully onto the already basted top edge of the backing/batting. Pin the quilt top about every 6"" like you did the batting. Tighten the belly roller again smoothing the 3 layers and set the brake. Now baste the quilt top onto the backing/batting at the top near the take-up roller. Remove the pins.
The reason I float my quilts is I was finding bunny ears or stretched corners on the bottom of my quilts when I used the zippers on the bottom of the quilt top. The quilting process shrinks or pulls in the quilt as you quilt it. Then when you get to the bottom and the bottom of the quilt top is nailed to the zipper, there can be no pulling in there so it does not seem to match the rest of the quilt. It's really just matter of preference. I'm sure there is a way to use the zipper without the bunny ears, I just don't know what it is.
You are now ready to start quilting. By the way, don't forget to have fun.",What is the process of loading a quilt on a longarm quilting machine?,"The process of loading a quilt on a longarm quilting machine involves several steps. First, the quilt backing is zipped onto the take-up and belly rollers. The backing is then rolled onto the belly roller, smoothing out any puckers and wrinkles. If the quilt is not being fully floated, the bottom of the quilt top is zipped onto the middle roller. The batting is then placed on top of the quilt backing and basted on. The quilt top is then laid on top of the already basted top edge of the backing/batting and basted onto the backing/batting at the top near the take-up roller. The reason for floating the quilts is to avoid stretched corners or bunny ears on the bottom of the quilts when using the zippers on the bottom of the quilt top. After these steps, one is ready to start quilting."

Monzoor Hussain, Lindsey Clark, Arshad Hussain, Hardeep Saini and Razwan Faraz were all senior leaders at PVET, which ran Park View Academy, Nansen Primary and Golden Hillock School.
The schools are among five in Birmingham plunged into special measures in April last year following an alleged plot by hardline Muslims to take control of governing bodies.
Giving evidence, the former Nansen head - referred to as ‘Witness C’ - claimed things changed in 2011 when it was decided the school should convert to an academy sponsored by PVET and Tahir Alam joined the governing body. Mr Alam was last month banned by the Department for Education from any involvement in schools for ‘undermining British values’.
Witness C said: “From that moment on there was constant bullying and harassment from all sides and I felt no one was listening to me. There were different agendas from everyone, from the governing body, Lindsey Clark and her team and the religious aspect of it.”
She claimed she was suspended by Ms Clark - former executive principal at PVET - in October 2012 when it was discovered the school’s fire alarm was not working properly and there was no evacuation procedure in place.
Witness C added: “When I was suspended I felt a great sense of relief that I was finally able to get out of the situation in which I had been bullied, harassed and intimidated.
“I decided I could not return to the school. I have never returned to education. The whole ordeal was traumatic and upsetting and it has taken me a long time to recover.”
Meanwhile, her witness statement said the governing body had left her feeling “undermined” and that they “wanted her gone”.
She said that in 2010 she moved the school from one that held Islamic assemblies to one with “multi-faith” ones. Her evidence claimed the move was strongly opposed by Monzoor Hussain, who was a governor at Nansen at the time as well as assistant headteacher at Park View.
She claimed two years later the governing body voted at a meeting she did not attend to reintroduce Islamic assemblies and Friday prayers. But she said the school did not have the facilities to cope with the prayer sessions.
“It was brought to my attention that there was chaos in the toilets because the children were trying to do ablution (act of washing themselves) before prayer and the school did not have the facilities to accommodate this,” she added.
“I found it astonishing that young children in a British state school were being encouraged to take part in Islamic prayer during the normal school day.
“I had never been asked about Friday prayers and I felt that if I challenged them I would have dug myself into a deeper hole and I would have been seen as a Muslim who is not religious and therefore considered unsupportive.
“I believe the responsibility of religion lies at home.”
The former headteacher criticised the selection of Razwan Faraz to the role of deputy head at Nansen in 2012, claiming he was not her preferred choice as he was “a bit green” and did not have strong enough leadership skills.
She claimed members on the recruitment panel, including Monzoor Hussain, were “good friends” with Razwan and had been seen leaving a restaurant with him just days before his interview for deputy headship.
She added: “Those who wanted to appoint Razwan, including Monzoor, were completely determined that he got the job and would not listen to my reasoning.”
Representing Monzoor Hussain, barrister Andrew Faux, said Witness C had applied for the school’s denomination to change from holding Islamic to multi-faith assemblies without consulting governors or parents - despite claiming the opposite on an application form to officials.
He claimed the governing body only “woke up” to the change two years later in 2010.
Claire Darwin, representing Razwan Faraz, added: “The law requires pupils to undertake collective worship at all state schools, no matter what faith.”
She said there were still Christian assemblies held at the predominantly Muslim school, and Razwan had sent Witness C an email urging her to ensure their quality were on a par with Islamic assemblies.
She said the recruitment panel had also selected a white non-Muslim teacher to a second role as deputy head and he was their top choice over Razwan.
She added: “This wasn’t a panel selecting candidates based on their religion or ethnicity.”
She also denied Razwan was good friends with any of the panel and insisted he had not gone to a restaurant with any of them ahead of his interview.
The teachers all deny the allegations and the hearing continues.",Who was banned by the Department for Education from any involvement in schools for 'undermining British values'?,Mr Alam was banned by the Department for Education from any involvement in schools for 'undermining British values'.

Roving Specialty Artist available for hire, based in Victoria
The Hobby Horses is an act combining puppetry, music, dance, comedy, and characters. The animal instinct of these horses is to embarrass their snobby horse-riders, giving the audience an enjoyable and very humorous spectacle. A visual treat of colour and movement, the Hobby Horses appeal to people of all ages.
Using classical and funky music, The Hobby Horses can also entertain in a non-verbal show. Choreographed in the style of equestrian and dressage events. The focus of the performance is the interplay between the horses (the puppets), the riders, and the audience. The human urge to complete and win an important and prestigious event inevitably clashes with the horse's urge to rebel and seek solace in eating and playing.
Hobby Horses have been seen at events such as the Melbourne Cup Carnival, the VRC Parade of Champions, Perth International Arts Festival, Melbourne International Arts Festival, and the Woodford Folk Festival.",What is the focus of the performance by the Hobby Horses?,"The focus of the performance is the interplay between the horses (the puppets), the riders, and the audience."

500,"Temple Church is the only commanderie in England we have ever visited. Unlike in France, they aren’t so thick on the ground. Only guessing, but the lack of surviving commanderies may be a product of the way their lands were parceled out after the fall of the order, combined with the Reformation, which destroyed many, if not most, religious sites throughout Britain. The Templars in England were disbanded but were allowed to continue living, which is one of the significant differences between what happened to the Templars in England as compared to in France.
Initially, the London Templars met at a location that had once been a Roman temple. But because of the rapid growth of the order since its founding in England in 1128, by the 1160s the site was too small, and the Templars established a larger monastic complex at Temple Church and made it their headquarters in England. In addition to the church, the new compound originally contained residences, military training facilities, and recreational grounds. The complex needed to be extensive to accommodate not only the numbers of knights but their novices, who were not permitted to go into the City without the permission of the Master of the Temple.
As in France, the Knights Templar wielded enormous influence in England, with the Master of the London Temple sitting in parliament. Their compound was regularly used as a residence by kings and legates of the Pope, and served as an safety-deposit bank, much as the Paris Temple at one time stored the treasury for the French crown.
The original church was consecrated in 1240 and is still visible today, consisting of a central aisle and two side aisles, north and south, of identical width. Looking up, the dome is just over 36 feet high. The church building itself has two separate sections: The original circular church building, called the Round Church, which now acts as a nave, and a rectangular section built later, which adjoins the nave on the east side, and which forms the chancel.
That the church is round is a nod to Christian holdings in the Holy Land, which include the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and the Dome of the Rock, which (though Muslim in origin) had been turned into a Church by the Augustinians. Both were featured on Templar iconography throughout the Middle Ages. In addition, after the Crusaders took Jerusalem in 1099, the Templars made the mosque adjacent to the Dome of Rock their headquarters.
In January 1215 William Marshall was instrumental in negotiating a treaty between King John and his barons at Temple Church, which resulted in Magna Carta. Marshall later became regent during the reign of John’s infant son, King Henry III. Henry later expressed a wish to be buried in the church. To accommodate this desire, in the early 13th century, the chancel of the original church was pulled down and a new larger chancel built, the basic form of which survives today. However, although one of Henry’s infant sons was buried in the chancel, Henry himself later altered his will to reflect his new wish to be buried in Westminster Abbey. William Marshal, on the other hand, as I said in last week’s video, himself became a Templar on his deathbed and was buried in the nave at Temple Church, and you can still see his tomb today.",What is the significant difference between what happened to the Templars in England and in France?,The Templars in England were disbanded but were allowed to continue living.

The Definition of the Alternatives is the Supreme Instrument of Power
The definition of the alternatives is the supreme instrument of power; the antagonist can rarely agree on what the issues are because power is involved in the definition.

Dirty Hippies, Inequality, and the Minnesota Model
The great Mark Price has a piece in the Guardian today, Wealth inequality will keep growing unless workers demand better, that gets to the heart of the problem with our broken economy’s failure to provide the security, opportunity, and basic needs we all deserve. Two points are worth mentioning. First, it’s taken as a matter of faith that conservative prescriptions for the economy are easy to understand and more left-leaning approaches are more complex. I think that’s rubbish. Read Mark here. It’s not difficult at all. If people don’t have jobs, they can’t spend, and we all suffer. If there are way more applicants then there are jobs, there’s no way out of this mess. Inequality is the problem, equality the solution. It’s not that hard. (I made the same point about Robert Reich before). He also discards the silly notion that government has been trying to fix this problem, or that the solutions are unclear.

1539,"There’s a profound feeling that shifts us outside the box of the routine and familiar and opens us to something much larger than ourselves writes Homaira Kabir. We’ve all felt it – the goose bumps on our arms when standing below towering Eucalyptus trees or the expansive feeling in our chests when watching the sun slowly set in the horizon.
Researchers define it as the emotion of awe. Like most positive emotions, it boosts physical health and inspires altruistic action. And yet, awe is more – because it recruits both motivations of the paradoxical human brain. It gives rise to a feeling of fear that is initiated in the more primitive parts of the brain. But it also opens us up to belonging to something much larger than the self, the most human of all needs. It is this whole brain functioning that is so essential for optimal performance, both in our personal lives and at work.
The Reality of the 21st Century Workplace
Most workplaces today function on the quick-fix, efficiency model of the industrial revolution that stands in direct contrast to awe-cultivation. It may have worked in an era when workers clocked in the necessary hours in order to live life after work. But in an age of evolving consciousness and where change, uncertainty and competition are the norm, we’re overworked, unhappy, and disengaged. Somewhere on the journey to progress, we seem to have lost our soul.
Why Awe May Be the Answer
Awe jars us out of our usual way of seeing things. But instead of making us resist change, it opens us up to the passing nature of life and to our integral, albeit tiny place in a much larger whole. We see our fragility and vulnerability, which gives us a profound sense of humility. But we also appreciate the vastness of experience, and the desire to leave something of ourselves behind in the world.
What Leaders Can Do to Cultivate It
Employees who are aware of their role in the organisation and driven to do their best to fulfill it are the “awe-struck” ones who can focus on what is important by connecting it to a larger purpose. Even though these capabilities lie in two separate hemispheres in our brains, we as humans are uniquely equipped to harness both at the same time. As leaders, we would do well to nurture this capacity.
- A daily practice of mindfulness develops the awareness to break through the safety of routine and the hammer wheel of emotions in order to experience a much larger sense of being alive.
- A mentor who has the potential to experience both the anxiety and the thrill of extending themselves beyond their comfort zone can help employees discover more of who they are and thus rise to their true potential.
- Visits to museums and operas are great ways to be moved by something powerful. Organisations that encourage employees to get in touch with the wholeness of their being help them bring their full selves to work.
- Organisations that take volunteering and “doing good” seriously answer an inherent human need to find meaning. Employees who can appreciate the positive effect of their work are intrinsically driven to do more.
- Connecting with nature is one of the best ways of belonging to something larger and of being reminded of the impermanence of life. It kindles the responsibility we carry towards it – something that is often forgotten in the daily churn of deadlines.
Tapping into an awe-based consciousness has profound implications for the way we live our lives. Instead of confining it to the spiritual realm, leaders would do well to nurture its daunting and exalting qualities in the workplace. But as Kirk Schneider, author of Awakening to Awe points out, it’s not a tool we can use at will. It’s at best a way of being – perhaps closer to the Taoist concept of wu-wei (pronounced ooo-way) – translated as “trying not to try”.
An enigma as paradoxical as the human brain.
PLEASE SHARE YOUR EXPERIENCES AND VIEWS IN THE COMMENT SECTION",How does the emotion of awe affect human health and behavior according to Homaira Kabir?,"The emotion of awe boosts physical health and inspires altruistic action. It gives rise to a feeling of fear that is initiated in the more primitive parts of the brain, but it also opens us up to belonging to something much larger than the self. It is this whole brain functioning that is essential for optimal performance, both in personal lives and at work."

""I am feeling so deeply fortunate."" I replied. ""Amazed. The devotees here seem to live with their hearts on their sleeves. They give their whole hearts in service. No walls.""
""Indeed, Brazilians have very open hearts,"" Amal Kirtan agreed.
""Yes! But I am wondering, Prabhu - if their hearts are so open, don't their hearts also get hurt much more easily?""
Amal Kirtan shook his head, ""Brazilians have very strong hearts. It's very hard to break a Brazilian heart,""
My eyes widened and I leaned forward in my seat. ""But why? How come??""
""Brazilians give and love with all their hearts, and if it gets hurt they also let it go. They know how to let go.""
I leaned back in my seat. ""Wow. They don't get so bitter or angry,""
""No, that's American!"" Amal Kirtan laughed, and I laughed, too.
Brazilians seem to live the open secret: let love flow.

This is a good thing, because if I had to eat as much as I exercise to keep this blog ticking over my life would be a constant circle of writing about Cadbury’s giant chocolate buttons and the excellent XXXL fashionwear available from Jacamo.
But now the dust has settled on my recent triathlon adventure, the bike wheels have stopped turning and the waves have subsided on the lake, I really should give a mention to my sponsors…and possibly the fourth discipline of a triathlon, fuelling the body.
I was lucky throughout training to receive box after box of Chobani yoghurts. I lost count of how many boxes, but enough that I wasn’t without a pot for the 5 weeks prior to the Jenson Button Trust Triathlon and for a week or two after. That’s 7 weeks of free yoghurt. You can imagine the pain of going cold turkey when I ran out…luckily I’ve found a local stockist to feed my new addiction (Tesco, Tewkesbury Road, Cheltenham).
Firstly, here’s what Chobani say about their yoghurt:
“We take fresh milk and add a special recipe of yoghurt cultures, blended just for us. We then authentically strain our yoghurt and add real fruit. The result is thick, creamy yoghurt that is packed with protein – an indulgent yet healthy treat”
“Contains five live active cultures including s.thermaphilus, bulgaricus, l.acidophilus, bifidus and l.casei.”
“0% fat and at least 13g of protein in every pot”
I don’t know what most of that means, but I do know that they taste amazing! The thick and creamy claim is totally founded, in fact when I opened my first one it was so thick I thought it was going to be chewy! But as soon as the spoon sunk in to it through to the real fruit in the bottom I knew I was in for a treat.
This prompted a debate, in fact I thought about starting an online poll but I had to go for a training swim instead. So I’ll just tell you how I enjoyed Chobani yoghurts…I’m a stirrer. That’s right, I rip the lid off, get in there with the spoon and give it a stir until the whole pot is a fruity yoghurt concoction. I know some of you are fruit at the bottom folk, there is no wrong or right, we’re just different (but you are wrong).
There’s 8 flavours of fruit Chobani available. I won’t list them, I’ll let you discover them for yourself, but I can confirm I would fight to the death for the last black cherry, blood orange or pomegranate Cho in the fridge. I wasn’t such a fan of the apple & cinnamon flavour but luckily my Nan was, so they went somewhere they were appreciated. This is a woman with many decades of dessert experience, a daily consumer of the finest yoghurts available in the Co-op, and she says Chobani is delicious. There can be no higher praise!
They also have a plain yoghurt in the range. There are people who can pour this on some nuts and seeds and call it breakfast. These people are slightly unhinged and should be seeking psychiatric help. However, I started adding a big dollop to my morning banana smoothie and it revolutionised an already excellent start to the day. While the fruit flavours have become a (far from occasional) treat, the plain is now a permanent addition to my fridge. Chobani also have a webpage full of recipes so anyone looking to boost their protein intake can do so easily while eating some delicious meals and snacks. So much better than throwing whey powder in to everything!
So there you have it. My first (and probably last) food review. Luckily it was for something I love so it was easy to wax lyrical, but I really do recommend you get hold of some Cho and give it a try, just not the last pomegranate one from my fridge…
Are you fruit at the bottom or stirred? Comment and let me know.
I need to check out the recipes! Because clearly I need more excuses to eat Chobani!
I am actually a lick-the-lid, fruit first person and I take a small slice out of the creamy top before trying my best to scrape all of the fruit from this small gap and then allowing myself the rest of the yoghurt. It’s the only way to eat the yoghurt. Amusement in a pot!

2381,"The future of higher education is always just around the corner.
In reality, some concepts have hardly changed in hundreds of years, while others come and go so quickly they could be mistaken for a myth.
As things stand in 2013, institutions need to be ready to keep their current ground as well as prepare for growing trends in the short- to mid-term future. Long-term is a given, although my main reason to not mention it is because stakes are strangely higher in the short-term at the moment. As David Kernohan recently mentioned, “Institutional management has become an increasingly short-term enterprise”.
Whether you look at universities as competing elements or a bunch of diverse individuals, it would be wise to pay attention to what each institution is up to. A Russell Group member shouldn’t rest on its laurels, despite the perceptions of relative safety within such company. They should look further afield and pay attention to decisions made by new universities, private providers, and overseas players. Everything and everyone should be watched with interest.
That’s just an example. No matter where your university hangs on the tree of esteem, it’ll be worth checking out the strategic moves of others across a wide area. Perhaps you complain that private providers are only in it for the money, but if their surprise move successfully captures an active audience it’ll be up to everyone else to catch up. For some, it may be too late to catch up:
“…as many as 20 to 30 current…institutions could become unviable if student demand continues to fall.” [THE]
The quote above refers to concerns from HE leaders interviewed by PA Consulting Group. It looks like everyone is vying for as much audience as possible. The report found the biggest major concerns were of a decline in postgraduate student demand and further reductions in funding. The biggest moderate concern was an inability to grow alternative sources of profitable revenues. Hence the continuing need for healthy numbers of bums on seats.
This may annoy some readers. “Students should not be seen as pound signs.” “Using admissions as a way to tempt people and dump them with little to speak of later is a disgrace.”
And there is a fine line. Institutions clearly need to highlight unique selling points to get a steady stream of keen applications. However, as Janet Graham, director of the Supporting Professionalism in Admissions programme, says in today’s Times Higher Education:
“.”
In essence, a short-term view still requires a long-term attitude. All the more reason to keep track of new developments within a wide scope and at an early stage, so you can catch a glimpse of what’s playing out with time to breathe. Ish.
You may not wish to emulate particular success stories, partially in view of Janet Graham’s point above. However, you should build an understanding of what processes are working, whether they are relevant to your institution, and how you might be able to incorporate something similar into your plans.
Anything that seems dangerous or unacceptable may still contain useful fodder for your own future actions. You may be able to use it in a more reasonable way to make the point.
Plus, you can see where trends are starting to emerge. A small pool of providers may make a move toward something unusual, for instance. That’s a cue to assess what is going on and evaluate why the sudden interest is there. Always be on the lookout for clues. What looks strange today might be pretty standard tomorrow.
There is only so much you can do through surveys and studies and action groups. You won’t be first in everything. But when you’re not first, you should at least be aware so you can make well reasoned decisions to be close behind with a solid plan, rather than lag at the back in a frenzied attempt to mop up whatever is left.
Awareness also allows the confidence to dismiss some moves outright. Though mistakes are equally possible from this direction, none of us have a magical crystal ball lying around to get it right every time. Keeping careful watch and consideration is a reasonable alternative.
Question why new decisions have been made. Consider undisclosed background reasons behind why that direction is being taken. Could it work for you? Does it make sense? Is it reasonable? What’s missing? How can you find out more?
The short-term is where it’s at right now. That doesn’t mean the need for brash decisions. On the contrary, it often requires more consideration than ever.

If he does end up waiting, that would defeat the purpose of the interim title and the UFC welterweight division would essentially be at a stand still for what could be 10-11 more months.

I really dont understand all the Condit bashing?? He is the most exciting fighter in the division who has fought and beaten the best the division has to offer. Which is more than can be said for Diaz. There is a big difference between running and clever footwork. He out struck Diaz and played a smart game. If you want to beat Diaz you have to move, simple. Why should he stand there and let him hit him??? would you??. And as for the big payday, why the fuck shouldnt he wait for it?? look at his record, look how many top notch competitors he has been up against. He deserves the payday, especially over Diaz (who I am a big fan of). To call him a marathon runner is retarded and shows you know nothing of Carlos or the fight game.

He was one of the most exciting fighters in the division. Till his gameplan to run away from Diaz.
The big difference between running and clever footwork? Frankie Edgar has the best footwork in the UFC but I've never seen him turn his back and run away from anyone. I thought Condit was the same type of fighter till that fight. He never ran from anyone before.
It was a good gameplan but a good gameplan would also be to hit a few leg strikes and get a takedown. Who the hell would want to see that.

- City of Cincinnati
- Boone County
- City of Florence
- Kenton County
- City of Covington
- Campbell County

- Save consumers $65 million in energy costs
The $17 million grant award helped the Energy Alliance to rapidly expand its offerings to local building owners and to develop an array of programs to generate energy savings. The Better Buildings partnership sparked a new energy efficiency industry in our region.
Home Performance with ENERGY STAR® Program
In 2011, the Energy Alliance became an officially recognized sponsor of the Home Performance with ENERGY STAR program developed by the U.S. Department of Energy and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
The ENERGY STAR brand is recognized by 84 percent of Americans, and its home performance program now has over fifty sponsors nationally. This partnership bolsters the success and credibility of the residential program.

Is Dwayne Haskins the best Maryland QB recruit of the modern era? Just *barely* not: pic.twitter.com/zGRCxEqafm— Testudo Times (@testudotimes) May 31, 2015
Haskins was the top target on Notre Dame's uncommitted board but never really felt like there was a ton of traction there after the Irish chased Malik Henry, Jacob Eason, Shea Patterson, and others in the early stages of this cycle.
Notre Dame never offered but (TN) Tylin Oden .876 committed to Louisville earlier last week. Several recruitniks have said in the past that he would have committed to the Irish if offered. We'll see if things change in the coming months.
Woody Barrett has a countdown clock as he'll be announcing his school tomorrow. Auburn is believed to have a very big lead and is expected to gain his commitment at 1:30 PM ET on Wednesday.
So where does Notre Dame turn now?
Well, QB coach Mike Sanford was recently down to see (TX) Sam Glaesmann .810 out of Midway H.S. in Waco. As of a couple weeks ago Glaesmann was planning on visiting and camping at Notre Dame this summer. However, late last week he did commit to Rice so we'll see if that changes his plans.
Notre Dame is not giving up on Arizona commit (CA) Khalil Tate .871 even though he's been a verbal to the Wildcats for nearly 3 months. There were Irish coaches on hand to watch him practice last week. It's kind of hard to believe a player from Junipero Serra would flip to Notre Dame stranger things have happened.

Notre Dame also recently offered Devwah Whaley out of Central Senior H.S. a little over an hour to the northeast of Houston, Texas. He recently named a Top 10 right before the Irish offer and it did not include Notre Dame.
Things are slipping for Elijah Holyfield. He was recently down at Alabama visiting and camping for the Crimson Tide coaching staff.
Notre Dame could be gaining something with Deon McIntosh who was visited by Autry Denson during the spring evaluation period. McIntosh said the Irish will make his top 10 when he comes out with one this summer.

1767,"Sieve Working Group K. Murchison Internet-Draft Carnegie Mellon University Obsoletes: 3598 (if approved) June 15, 2006 Expires: December 17, 2006 Sieve Email Filtering -- Subaddress Extension draft-ietf-sieve-rfc3598bis 1. Introduction Subaddressing is the practice of augmenting the local-part of an [RFC2822] address with some 'detail' information in order to give some extra meaning to that address. One common way of encoding 'detail' information into the local-part is to add a 'separator character sequence', such as ""+"", to form a boundary between the 'user' (original local-part) and 'detail' sub-parts of the address, much like the ""@"" character forms the boundary between the local-part and domain. Typical uses of subaddressing might be: o A message addressed to ""ken+sieve@example.org"" is delivered into a mailbox called ""sieve"" belonging to the user ""ken"". o A message addressed to ""5551212#123@example.com"" is delivered to the voice mailbox number ""123"" at phone number ""5551212"". This document describes an extension to the Sieve language defined by  4. Subaddress Comparisons Test commands that act exclusively on addresses may take the optional tagged arguments "":user"" and "":detail"" to specify what sub-part of the local-part of the address will be acted upon. NOTE: In most cases, the envelope ""to"" address is the preferred address to examine for subaddress information when the desire is to sort messages based on how they were addressed so as to get to a specific recipient. The envelope address is, after all, the reason a given message is being processed by a given sieve script for a given user. This is particularly true when mailing lists, aliases, and 'virtual domains' are involved since the envelope may be the only source of detail information for the specific recipient. NOTE: Because the encoding of detailed addresses are site and/or implementation specific, using the subaddress extension on foreign addresses (such as the envelope ""from"" address or originator header fields) may lead to inconsistent or incorrect results. The "":user"" argument specifies the user sub-part of the local-part of an address. If the address is not encoded to contain a detail sub- part, then "":user"" specifies the entire left-side of the address (equivalent to "":localpart""). The "":detail"" argument specifies the detail sub-part of the local- part of an address. If the address is not encoded to contain a detail sub-part, then the test evaluates to false. If a zero-length string is encoded as the detail sub-part, then "":detail"" resolves to the empty value (""""). NOTE: If the encoding method used for detailed addresses utilizes a separator character sequence, and the separator character sequence occurs more than once in the local-part, then the logic used to split the address is implementation defined, and is usually dependent on the format used by the encompassing mail system. Implementations MUST make sure that the encoding method used for detailed addresses matches that which is used and/or allowed by the encompassing mail system, otherwise unexpected results might occur. Note that the mechanisms used to define and/or query the encoding method used by the mail system are outside the scope of this document. The "":user"" and "":detail"" address parts are subject to the same rules and restrictions as the standard address parts defined in  [""subaddress"", ""fileinto""]; # In this example the same user account receives mail for both # ""ken@example.com"" and ""postmaster@example.com"" # File all messages to postmaster into a single mailbox, # ignoring the :detail part. if envelope :user ""to"" ""postmaster"" { fileinto ""inbox.postmaster""; stop; } # File mailing list messages (subscribed as ""ken+mta-filters""). if envelope :detail ""to"" ""mta-filters"" { fileinto ""inbox.ietf-mta-filters""; } # Redirect all mail sent to ""ken+foo"". if envelope :detail ""to"" ""foo"" { redirect ""ken@example.net""; } Murchison Appendix A.

1309,"Dentsu Aegis Network Holds Industry’s First-ever Regional Demo Day for Female-founded Startups
21 Dec 2016
Dentsu Aegis Network is pleased to announce the launch of its regional female-founded startup Demo Day, a first-of-its-kind in the industry, hosted by programme partner – Google, on 14 December in Singapore.
As part of its Female Foundry Accelerator Programme – an initiative to mentor, develop and help fund female start-ups in South and Southeast Asia, the event spotlighted eight female founders from across the region whose businesses spanned across a diverse range of industries from health and fashion to social and marketing.
These tech-focused startups were given the opportunity to present their work, Demo Day rounded off a two month long programme which started in October, consisting of a bootcamp where the eight selected female founders learnt about digital, marketing, finance and operations from Dentsu Aegis Network’s senior management. In addition, they were paired with experienced industry mentors where weekly consultation sessions were arranged.
Tracy Wong, Founder of Infini Videos, said “This opportunity is a huge stepping stone for us as a female-founded business. There aren’t many initiatives catered to women with tech-focused startups but as the world becomes more digitalized, there is an importance in the convergence of technology and businesses. Dentsu Aegis recognizes this trend and brought women from across the region to learn from each other which was both a motivating and humbling experience.”
Ruth Stubbs, Global President iProspect and Chair of Female Foundry, said: “Our ambition with Female Foundry was to provide a platform for passionate female-founded start-ups to access funding. Our accelerator program was established to provide structured connections to networks and mentors, with the full backing and support of Dentsu Aegis Network.
“As more and more women in Asia are using smart technology solutions to start their own businesses, we hope our industry will provide more platforms to help support and empower. Female Foundry and our commitment will continue into 2017 and we will also be extending our program into Latin America and Africa to raise the voice of women from emerging markets, who are dominant players in the growth of ecommerce. Ultimately, we hope to reshape and fuel this emerging ecosystem,” added Ruth.

Strikeforce: Nashville Main Card Predictions
Gilbert Melendez (c) VS. Shinya Aoki
First of all, this is a huge fight for both of these fighters. A win for Aoki can solidify the fact that he may be one of the best pound for pound lightweights. Aoki already holds the DREAM lightweight title, and if he defeats Melendez will also hold the Strikeforce lightweight title. However, if anybody out there has watched Aoki fight, its apparent that he can not take a punch very well. In DREAM, he was knocked out by Hayato Sakurai and Joachim Hansen. On the other hand his opponent, Gilbert Melendez, has never been knocked out (or TKO'd) in his 17-2 MMA career. Although Gilbert has a purple belt in Jiu-Jitsu, and trains with Cesar Gracie and the Diaz brothers, I have to give the ground advantage to Aoki, that dude is an animal on the ground. In contrast, if Melendez can find a way to avoid Aoki's take downs, and stay off the ground, Aoki will get knocked out very quickly.
Gilbert Melendez- Win via TKO in the first round.
Gegard Mousasi (c) VS. Muhammed Lawal
Haha. To say the very least this fight is going to be funny to watch. I honestly don't think ""King Mo"" has the right to even fight Mousasi. The guy is 6-0 and hasn't fought anybody THAT good. He says, ""Mousasi is beatable."" Yeah, I agree he is beatable, but not by ""King Mo."" Gegard Mousasi is one of the top ranked light heavyweights in the world. Personally, I don't think Lawal has any more right to fight Mousasi then Sokoudju did. Lawal should just stick to trash talking other fighters in different weight classes (Josh Koscheck). Cover Up ""King Mo."" Remeber, you can always tapout from getting punched.
Gegard Mousasi- Win via TKO in the second round
Jake Shields (c) VS. Dan Henderson
This makes for a VERY interesting fight. I am curious how Jake Shields plans to take down an Olympic caliber wrestler like Dan Henderson and use his ""American Jiu-Jitsu"" to submit him. Does anyone remember the Paul Daley VS Jake Shields in which Shields was literally afraid to stand with Daley? This fight is like that except Henderson hits harder than Daley and has 100 times better wrestling. It looks like Jake Shields' 13 fight win streak will be coming to an end on Saturday night. Dan Henderson for knockout of the year two years in a row? Let's see if your stand up has gotten any better Shields and say hello to the new Strikeforce middleweight champion.

It was tough and it was at times frustrating, but I'm pretty proud of myself for getting in pretty much all of the workouts that I had planned for myself. This self-coaching business is taking a lot of getting used to and I definitely had many periods over the last week of doubt and worry about my fitness level and about whether I will be ""ready"" to race in a few weeks. But consistent workouts and following the plan are helping to boost my confidence. Add in a few workouts with some good friends and the fun factor was covered off as well!
Monday: Run - 8k. I tricked myself into a longer run by purposely heading in the opposite direction of my house after work (I'm still run commuting for now, though revisiting whether I will continue much longer). Normally, I pass by our house about 3.5k in if I head toward home, and it can be very tempting to just go into the house. So, I ran over to the Quebec side of the river first, which forced me to extend the run by quite a bit. The run was not great - heart rate way too high, some gastro discomfort, etc. But I did it! And then I got to go pick up my bike from FedEx.
Tuesday: Swim - 2200m. I made it back to ROCS! This was a big win for the week. Now, mind you, I actually cried on deck when I realized that it was long course. It was never long course on Tuesdays last year. But I forced myself to get into the pool, and it wasn't so bad. (Swim demons obviously still linger.)
Thursday: I turned my Thursday into my rest day, as I wasn't feeling a 6 am (long course again) swim. Plus in the evening, I had to be home to meet Adam from Velofix Ottawa for my new bike!
Friday: Swim - 2650m completed. I pulled myself out of bed for my morning swim with ROCS and was glad that I did. While I am definitely far off the times that I need to be hitting, they seemed a little bit closer at this workout.
Saturday: Trail run - 8k. Jenn and I took to the Wolf Trail for a ""hard effort"" run. We had contemplated signing up for a local 10k trail race, but in the end decided to do it on our own. Man, trail running is hard. Running hard is also hard. My body was in utter shock after the lack of hard effort training lately. I also ate it and ended up with a bruised and bloody left knee after a fall (on a flat section, of course). The second half of the trail slowed us down quite a bit, as it was steeper, muddier, and rockier on the descent. We finished off with a little dip (toes only for me) in Meech Lake, which is definitely not warm enough yet for swimming! It was like an ice bath, though it felt amazing after a hard run in (finally) warm temperatures.
Sunday: Bike - 64k. Jenn, Dave and I braved some crazy wind on our ride out to Carp. At times it felt like we might be blown sideways off our bikes, and then at other times it felt like we weren't actually moving forward. We stopped for a nice snack at Alice's Cafe (a great reward for the windy ride), then turned around to head home. It was mostly smooth sailing on the way back and we completed the distance in about half the time! Always nice to have good company when the riding is tough!

On running: ""Why I Run"" by Nick Triolo
On owning your strengths: ""Stop Using Qualifiers"" by Carrie Cheadle
I read EVERY ONE of your posts, so I'll help keep you accountable ;) You are off to a great start with the self coaching! I find that the motivation factor is what I am sometimes missing and craving by coaching myself. I hope you are loving your new bike! Have you taken it for a spin yet?! Carrie Cheadle's post really resonated with me this week as well! I know she is a busy woman, but I really wish she would write posts more frequently...I really enjoy her work ;) If you haven't read her book yet, you should...it is great!!",What activities were included in the week's training plan?,"The week's training plan included running, swimming, and biking."
314,"On Balance, Progress In North Korean Issue
Three noteworthy things happened after the North Koreans detonated a small nuclear device on Oct. 9.
First, the test itself was something of a fizzle, with the explosion being smaller than perhaps the North Koreans had planned and hoped for. This may have shown them that they weren't as far along in developing a workable atomic weapon as they had thought.
Second, the Chinese government's reaction was quite negative. China joined in the moderate sanctions that were adopted at the U.N., it joined the banking sanctions in Macao that the U.S. had encouraged, and it apparently cut some military aid to North Korea and threatened further cuts. All this showed that the Chinese, like the Bush Administration and the Japanese, were concerned about the prospect that North Korea could become a full fledged nuclear power.
Third, the U.S. abandoned its policy of not talking to the North Korean regime of Kim Jong Il directly. The Administration sent its able lead negotiator, Christopher Hill, to Berlin to talk bilaterally with the lead North Korean negotiator, and out of this precedent-setting meeting came the bare bones agreement that has now been reached in the six-party talks in Beijing.
Anything can happen. Past agreements with the North Koreans have not proved lasting. But in this case, the North Koreans stand to receive quite a bit more in aid, in oil and so on, if they honor their assurance that their main nuclear plant will be shut down within 60 days and let in U.N. inspectors to verify that it has been. Further steps, such as disassembly of present nuclear weapons and/or turning them over to international bodies, have not been ruled out.
It could well be that once Kim Jong Il begins moving in a more peaceful direction, the pressures on his regime will build to undertake even more reforms. North Korea, to put it mildly, has not been an economic success. Like East Germany in 1989, once the ice is broken, pressures may well build up on the regime for even more substantive change. In this respect, South Korea, Japan and China can all be helpful to the U.S.
Once it became obvious that the Bush Administration was in no mind to undertake military action to block North Korea becoming a nuclear power, then some such deal was probably in the cards, and we now have to wait to see what happens next.
It also should be recognized that what happens with North Korea may have some impact on the relations of the U.S. and other Western countries with Iran in respect to its nuclear plans.
Just this morning, at his news conference, President Bush joined the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen. Pace, in distancing himself somewhat from anonymous U.S. military briefers in Baghdad over the weekend who had suggested that senior members of the Iranian government were responsible for the alleged use of Iranian weapons, such as roadside bombs and other anti-tank devices, against American forces in Iraq.
It could well be that, just as Hill's contact with the North Koreans proved useful in Berlin, some mid level bilateral diplomatic exchanges may soon get underway between the U.S and Iran, looking forward at least to stemming tensions that have been building up between the U.S. and Iran in the Iraq war and elsewhere in the Middle East.
One place to watch is Lebanon. If Iran backs off there, and Hezbollah suspends or lessens its efforts to depose the Siniora government, it could be viewed as an introductory positive step. But yesterday's bombing of a bus carrying civilians in Lebanon, the first such attack, was ominous. Also, of course, the doings of the Iraqi radical, Moktada al-Sadr, who reportedly has gone to Iran, bear watching.

The departure of Vernon Loeb, an investigative editor at the L.A. Times, to return to the Philadelphia Inquirer as metro editor is another sign that under Tribune ownership, and all the uncertainties about the Times future that that entails, the paper is losing key personnel and sinking. Tribune did enter into one sale this week, that of Hoy, its Spanish-language paper, in New York. But it has not proceeded expeditiously as yet to make other sales, and its stock price continues a slow decline. Unless the Times is sold soon, the departures of John Balzar, Alissa Rubin and now, Vernon Loeb, will only be followed by others.
Loeb was a leader in the Times city room in trying to fashion reforms at the paper. He was a strong and outspoken supporter of the ousted editor, Dean Baquet. Under the circumstances, we can only wish him well at the Inquirer.

705,"On the back of my last post i’ve been thinking a lot about how I can transform my classroom to better cater for the kids of todays world. To foster and encourage creativity and innovation and have them engaged within a learning environment that breaks away from the norm and gives them a sense of belonging.
So after ‘sketch noting’ up a storm, see below ;), i’ve attempted to mockup a learning environment using my current space that reflects 21st Century teaching and learning. I love the whole notion of learning space and learning space design and love seeing how other educators have their learning spaces set up.
Having heard him countless times and even had the opportunity to work alongside him, Stephen Heppell is a person whose ideology around what learning spaces look and feel like are well noted. His website at contains great information about all things learning space design and i have certainly adopted some of his thinking.
Documents such as those shared below via a dropbox folder are also great reads, albeit a little ‘departmentalised’, yet give clear insights into what perhaps an effective learning space can be and or should be. If this is the case though within these documents why are more school classrooms not like this…? The million dollar question!
The TEDx Talk below via Sean Corcorran is a great 17min watch and hearing Sean’s thoughts and philosophies relating to some of the thinking that goes into learning space design is terrific.
To cap this post off and on the back of my image below, i simply thought that I would describe my ideal classroom. Some, if not all, is certainly achievable and time to implement at least some of the below will be the only obstacle!
Here we go…
“I want a classroom space that belongs to my students. A space that they want to come to because it is safe, exciting and has purpose. Furniture is to be mixed and not all the same to cater for various learners. Bean bags, collaborative tablespaces, standing height benches, moveable seating, writable surfaces (walls and tables), and isolation, or independent, break out spaces are to be all complemented with natural lighting. I am also a big fan of ‘rooms within rooms’ for student to break away from what is happening in class and to have an environment that lessens interruptions to their learning. A great example of this is via the work Matt Ives, an educator from New Zealand is doing around Design Thinking, his blog can be located here.
I’d also love to have furniture that encourages physical activity, such as having to climb, crawl, or whatever it may be to gain access to a specific space. The examples below I think would be awesome! I think also having exercise machines such as exercise bikes in the classroom would also be fantastic and I am certain that they’d get used!
Here are three older images I located showing just a few of the things I mentions happening at my College.
Students, like those who work at Google, are to also have constant access to food and snacks throughout the day. We as adults are not restricted and told when to eat, our students should not be either. Obviously a focus geared towards healthy eating and brain food will be encouraged and not 500ml Cans of Red Bull!
Within the class there is to be a ‘makerspace‘ to foster and encourage student innovation and creativity that is NOT confined to the curriculum being taught. This also will be relevant towards teaching students to code within year levels where it is not stated within the curriculum. The use of other technologies to drive some of the above (MaKey MaKey, Arduino, iBeacon Tech, etc…) will certainly drive some very powerful learning. The greatest inventors of out time were never restricted to a syllabus!
To make the space personal I would like students to share achievements regarding things that they have achieved outside of school. To see their interests and passions that drive who they are and then for them to bring these passions into the classroom. My classroom would also be shoeless (A Heppell philosophy), to ensure comfort levels are optimum. I would also have no college/school uniform however I think that will be my one major sticking point. 😉 This all relates to the classroom belonging to the students.
My classroom would also be technology rich. Students having access to multiple devices, especially with an emphasis on using their own. I would have charging stations (OH&S, meh…), and a range of other attachments to suit individual learning needs. I would have a mobile LED TV, preferably interactive, that students could airplay, mirror their devices to. I would want this mobile so as to not make it the main point of the room. It would be flexible enough that I could use it with 1, 5, 10, or the whole class. I could turn it so others could not see it so as to not distract. In saying this it is exactly what I have now, apart from the interactivity, and it is brilliant! Also, and another point I heard off Mr. Heppell, is that I’d love to have ‘Skype’ or ‘Google Hangout’ bars. PLaces where students could interact and connect with others wherever they may be. Why should learning be limited to only the classroom and what is on the internet. Why should students not be able to connect with other experts, no matter where they are! As the American Educator Will Richardson puts it… “There are approx. 2.5 Billion People online. This can be seen as 2.5 billion predators, or, 2.5 billion teachers… You choose.”
Students would have the opportunity to present their work/findings/understandings in ways which play to their strengths and that also encourage a greater global audience.
I think that i’ll stop here. I could perhaps go on but for now, if my classroom was everything that I have just mentioned above, I would be a pretty happy man. I think that my students would be even happier though!",What are some of the features of the ideal classroom described in the context?,"The ideal classroom described in the context includes a space that belongs to the students, mixed furniture to cater for various learners, writable surfaces, isolation or independent break out spaces, natural lighting, 'rooms within rooms', furniture that encourages physical activity, constant access to food and snacks, a 'makerspace' to foster creativity, technology-rich environment with multiple devices, mobile LED TV, 'Skype' or 'Google Hangout' bars, and opportunities for students to present their work in ways which play to their strengths."

1064,"As an exercise in self-discipline, I decided to post on this blog everyday for a week, starting today. Remember the post about the first stretch of my walk with Anuradha Goyal? I thought I'd begin the week with the rest of the walk - from Mahboob Chowk to Purana Pul, via Hussaini Alam, Hyderabad's oldest neighborhood, where the nobles of the Qutb Shahi and Asaf Jahi courts once lived. The main roads of Hussaini Alam and Karwan are undoubtedly the quaintest parts of Hyderabad. They ooze culture and history, and walking through them is the closest you can get to time travel.
After watching the making of Hyderabadi naan for a few minutes, we walked past the tiny shops of Mahboob Chowk, most of which weren't open yet.
A little past the chowk and almost into Hussaini Alam, we found a bright yellow math called Sri Alakh Ka Math. We went in to find a tiny temple with an assortment of idols of Gods and Goddesses.
One of the best things about early morning photowalks is taking pictures of signboards. The colours, the different languages, the typography, the quirky spellings - what's not to love!
This boy saw me with the camera, put on his jacket hurriedly and asked me to take a picture of him. I'm still quite shy about asking strangers if I can take their picture, so I LOVE it when they come and ask :)
We ran into an old man selling Adrak Murabba - ginger preserved and dried in a syrup of sugar and spices.
Although we didn't eat any of the murabba, we were pretty hungry, so we stopped at a small tiffin center for breakfast.
This is the beautiful dargah of Hazrath Syed Moosa Shah Qadri. A structure this gorgeous deserves a post of its own - later this week.
Horse carriages used in wedding processions at night, rest in the morning all along Hussaini Alam.
There were carts and carts selling Jamuns, and Anuradha bought some to take home.
We were now almost at Purana Pul, and we ended the walk with some chai - Irani, of course.
What a lovely place to go for a photo-walk and as you mentioned, the early morning time offers plenty of opportunities to photograph things at both leisure and which might be hidden during the busier times of the day. I love taking pictures of sign-boards too!
My personal favorites would have to be the ones of the jamuns and the little jacket-wearing boy:)
Thank you Priyanka! Yeah, mornings are totally the best - that way photowalks need not even stop for the summer :)
Nice pictures! I love when shops are closed
Thank you Celine :)
Cool..
Thank you so much for a great idea and blog. I checked out of my hotel in Hyderabad at 6 am with seven hours to spare. And I simply followed your blog's trail.
I didn't go up to Purana Pul but ended with heavenly breakfast at Govind Tiffin near Mitti ka Sher.
Documented on my blog.

1370,"After a day, I found that, in Unity dashboard, there is a recent-files box showing ALL THE FILES I opened.
I don't like anyone to see what I have opened. A possible scenario would be I have to show other people how to do something, either locally or remotely, and they could see what I have opened (meaning the ""files"" I have in my machine.) I will not have any privacy at all.
I searched and found that the ""recent-files"" list is stored in a file named ""recently-used.xbel"" under ""/home/YOURUSERNAME/.local/share/""
Example content of the file:
<xbel version=""1.0"" xmlns: <bookmark added=""2012-05-07T03:55:02Z"" href="""" modified=""2012-05-07T03:55:02Z"" visited=""2012-05-07T03:55:02.049049Z""> <info> <metadata owner=""""> <mime:mime-type <bookmark:groups> <bookmark:group>Graphics</bookmark:group> </bookmark:groups> <bookmark:applications> <bookmark:application </bookmark:application></bookmark:applications> </mime:mime-type></metadata> </info> </bookmark> </xbel>
A way to empty the list is to empty the file(or delete it with ""rm""), to empty the file use this command:
echo -n > ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel
This can be made into a shell script and to make it clickable whenever one needs to clean the history.
Or put the script in startup application list to clean it every time the machine starts.
** There is also an old trick for Ubuntu <12.04 to make a directory named ""recently-used.xbel"" in its place, instead of a file. Unfortunately, someone said it doesn't work with the new Ubuntu (I also haven't tested that yet).
Above method will just deal with the history storage, we did not touch the application that do the ""logging"" yet.
The logging application is called ""zeitgeist-daemon"" running in the background.
It might be possible to remove Zeitgeist-daemon from your system, on this page suggest that you could do these command both in order to get rid of it.
sudo apt-get --purge remove zeitgeist sudo apt-get autoremoveAlthough, there is another way to disable or configure(if you just want partial of it to enabled.)_It is to use ""Activity Log Manager"".
** in this blog, it seems that Activity Log Manager owned its place in ""System->Privacy"". Although, I couldn't find it there. So, I installed it manually.
To install and use Activity Log Manager:
sudo apt-get install activity-log-manager activity-log-manager
The application will launched and it looks like this:
on the first page, you can choose when to delete the logged activities, or manually delete it.
There is also a switch at the bottom to enable/disable the activity logging program(zeitgeist).
On the second tab, you'll see more option to configure for file-opened logging. You can discard logging on specific file types, or discard logging files from a specific folder.
On the third tab, there is application-level configuration. Meaning, it will ignore logging for the application you have put in this list.
After finish configuring, close the Activity Log Manager, logout, and login again. Now it'll log only what you want it to log and show only that to Unity dashboard.
** Actually, Zeitgeist is still logging EVERYTHING and put it into ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel but it just does not show on Unity dashboard. Therefore, it's good to clean the file once in a while.
ref:

sudo apt-get --purge remove zeitgeist
sudo apt-get autoremove
those commands are works, ""recently used files"" are gone
thank u AniDear
I've deleted ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel and created a folder with exactly the same name. I't works... no more logging
Here is another permanent solution. Edit recently-used.xbel to make sure it is empty, or just keep the files you want in there. Then save and open terminal.
Type this
sudo chattr +i ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel
this will lock the file, so that even root cannot edit it.
Works for me, I hope it works for you.","How can one clear the ""recent-files"" list in Unity dashboard?","The ""recent-files"" list can be cleared by emptying or deleting the file named ""recently-used.xbel"" under ""/home/YOURUSERNAME/.local/share/"".

992,"Life and death: Outstanding writing, acting and directing sets the tone for production
Published in The Olympian and The News Tribune, March 26, 2010
Pictured: Jason Haws as Howie, Megan Kappler as Becca, Melanie Moser as Izzie and Kathy Dorgan as Nat
Photo by TORSTUDIOS.COM
Imagine invisibility. You sit for months unseen in a corner chair in Howie and Becca Corbett’s living room watching the family wrestle with the unspeakable grief brought about by the loss of a young child.
Four-year-old Danny Corbett has been accidentally killed, and if they’re not careful, their conflicting manners of coming to terms with grief (or avoiding it) may destroy the family.
If this story were a made-for-television movie, or if it were produced by a less-skilled cast and crew, it would be a gut-wrenching drama, but as performed by Harlequin Productions under the able direction of Brian Tyrrell, it is a strangely quiet production. Thus the feeling you are sitting in that chair watching the family.
“Rabbit Hole” won the Pulitzer Prize in 2007. It was written by David Lindsay-Abaire (“Fuddy Meers” and “Kimberly Akimbo”). Harlequin’s production stars Megan Kappler as Becca and Jason Haws as her husband, Howie; Melanie Moser as Becca’s sister Izzy; Kathy Dorgan as their mother and Peter Beard as Jason, the high school student who accidentally ran down their son.
The set by Jill Carter is the palpably real interior of the Corbett’s living and dining rooms, a kitchen with a fully stocked refrigerator, and Danny’s upstairs bedroom. The details are impeccable, from their snack foods and laundry to the light in Danny’s room and the light cast on Howie’s face from the television only he watches.
In the Broadway production, a revolving set was used. I can’t say for sure because I didn’t see it, but I suspect I would have found that too theatrical. I like that there were no set changes and no dramatic lighting or music at Harlequin.
The only thing remotely theatrical about this production was a little music and dimming of lights for scene changes (lighting by Paul Purvine as nuanced as the acting).
Despite intense arguments between each of the characters and emotional breakdowns by both Howie and Becca, I found myself strangely emotionally detached from the action, perhaps because Lindsay-Abaire’s brilliant dialogue and the cast’s nuanced acting avoided all of the usual tricks of tapping into emotion and simply presented real people in a real situation.
For example, in the opening scene I thought Becca’s words and expressions were out of sync with one another. Her words expressed shock and anger as she calmly folded laundry while bantering with Izzy.
For a few moments, I wondered why she kept folding that damn laundry, and why her actions didn’t fit her words. Gradually, it dawned on me that she had shut off all emotion, and that the clothes she was folding belonged to her dead son.
That is outstanding writing, directing and acting, and it set the tone for the entire play.
While Kappler portrayed Becca’s tightly wrapped grief, Haws portrayed Howie’s grief much differently – abruptly and usually inappropriately shouting at Becca or Izzy and then immediately reining in his anger.
Haws typically shines in outsized roles such as John Merrick in “The Elephant Man” or the outlandishly humorous Bottom in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” In this role, he proves that he can play an everyman with controlled intensity.
Dorgan is a natural as the meddling mother who, like her daughter, tries unsuccessfully to keep a lid on her emotions.
Beard is the quietest and most controlled of all the cast. He barely speaks, appears shy and painfully polite, and is obviously bottling up his pain.
The most animated and most likable of all is Moser as the outlandish sister who also bottles up her pain but under a faade of humor and bravado.
This play is definitely not for children. It is anything but light entertainment. There is no hopeful, movie-of-the-week resolution, nothing to mitigate the pain. You might not go away in awe of the dramatic effect, but you will go away feeling like you’ve shared life and death.

1889,"Jump Trading makes the jump to VAST Data for cutting-edge machine-learning models
Chicago-headquartered trading firm Jump Trading has always sought an edge. Jump is a research-based organization committed to using the latest technology to innovate and push through scientific boundaries — and it applies this to financial markets all over the globe. Jump has over 20 offices in the United States, Europe and Asia. ""Our success is reliant upon our ability to make ever-growing amounts of data available, quickly, for cutting-edge research pipelines,"" explained Alex Davies, technology leader at Jump Trading responsible for both Jump's low latency and High Performance Computing infrastructure.
""Every day the global financial markets create incredible amounts of new data that we need to consume, and our success is reliant upon our ability to make this data available to researchers — and available quickly,"" Davies said. Davies knows better than most that in the competitive world of algorithmic trading, small increases in model accuracy can mean the difference between windfall profits and catastrophic losses. ""The most productive quants have the competitive advantage, and a huge amount of that productivity relies on fast access to massive amounts of data,"" said Davies.
Everyone knows that to make money, you have to spend money. But justifying a significant outlay of the type needed to create a competitive advantage using traditional means can be difficult to do. Flash storage is expensive at scale, and even costlier at high performance levels. The most efficient flash storage of the type required by Jump is extremely expensive.
Or rather, it used to be. ""We focus on customers that find themselves at the intersection of both performance and scalability,"" said Jeff Denworth, co-founder of VAST, which democratizes fast access to data by combining industry-leading techniques to simplify and speed up storage and access to data in real time, at lightning speed. VAST does this by consolidating multiple data storage tiers. The VAST Data Universal Storage makes it possible to store all data on a single tier of fast, scalable and affordable flash, so that customers don't have to deal with complex data movement workflows or high application wait times as data moves between the various tiers of storage.
VAST is growing fast and innovating, and it doesn't seem to be stopping""
""The mission of VAST is to be an extinction-level event for the hard drive,"" said Denworth. VAST recognized that solving the cost problem and adding elements of system scalability unlocked the market and offered enormous returns for clients. The company was founded in 2016 with that premise; by 2018, it sold its first product. Within three months, VAST was well on its way: It sold more than any storage company ever had in its first year of operation. ""We've not only changed the paradigm in terms of how people think about managing their data, and how people get fast access to all of their data, but also by focusing on scalability,"" said Denworth.
It was a perfect fit for Jump. VAST recognized earlier than most that the dual rise of AI and machine learning would upend the data infrastructure market. Customers are realizing that they need fast access to the largest amounts of data in their data center in order to make their models more accurate and effective (by exposing them to the largest sample data sets). Jump selected VAST because it had cracked the code to obtain great capacity and performance.
VAST can crack that code in part because of the tech hardware it runs on: Its own Universal Storage architecture is powered by Intel Optane SSDs and Intel QLC 3D NAND Technology. Intel Optane SSDs provide endurance and high performance for writes, and Intel QLC 3D NAND SSDs are affordable, high-capacity NAND flash drives that deliver great read performance. VAST has also found a way to achieve 20 times the benchmarked longevity of Intel QLC 3D NAND SSDs, meaning customers can deploy super-fast, high-performance storage that lasts for a decade, compared to the industry standard of three to five years. ""We use these technologies to overcome a number of shortcomings that you would traditionally find in storage systems,"" said Denworth — and VAST passes that on to its customers.
When Jump migrated the backbone of its trading archive infrastructure over to VAST, it quickly witnessed the positive impact. ""VAST makes a difference on how quickly Jump can access what they need when they need it,"" said Davies. Denworth added: ""We were factors less expensive than any other all-flash system they could otherwise purchase, which allows Jump to put more data on a platform than any other system for the same investment dollar.""
By building out capacity and speeding up compute times for that data, Jump was able to feed more information into its algorithms to enable those algorithms to make more informed trading decisions. ""The concept has completely changed customers' perceptions and market appetite for high-performance infrastructures,"" said Denworth, who claimed that the VAST on-premises all-flash storage investment is around one-sixtieth of the cost of deploying in the cloud.
""VAST has changed the economics of flash storage,"" said Davies. ""It's making flash affordable at large scale — and less expensive for all kinds of data and data sets."" The market has taken notice: Last quarter, VAST's average contract value was $2 million. In May, the company took on $83 million in series D funding, valuing VAST at $3.7 billion — three times its value in April 2020. ""When investors hear that we built a business that, in our second year of operation, hit a $150 million run rate and achieved cashflow positivity, people love it,"" said Denworth.
""VAST is growing fast and innovating, and it doesn't seem to be stopping,"" said Davies. ""We're reassured to be partnered with a company that is well-capitalized and growing."" Trading firms like Jump are far from the sole use case for VAST Universal Storage: Multiple industries that require rifling through vast quantities of data at great speed are starting to adopt VAST technology to power their businesses, including health care, research institutions, federal government, manufacturing, and media and entertainment.
""We're still in the first inning of the proliferation of AI and machine learning across the enterprise, but no doubt that it is the killer use case for distributed storage,"" said Denworth. ""It is being infused into every application and our job is to modernize the data infrastructure so that it is accessible and can work with AI at any scale.""",Why did Jump Trading choose VAST Data for their data storage needs?,"Jump Trading selected VAST Data because it had cracked the code to obtain great capacity and performance. VAST Data's Universal Storage makes it possible to store all data on a single tier of fast, scalable and affordable flash, eliminating complex data movement workflows or high application wait times as data moves between the various tiers of storage. This allowed Jump Trading to feed more information into its algorithms to enable those algorithms to make more informed trading decisions."

576,"East Jackson’s second loss this season somewhat mirrored its first.
The Eagles (4-2) found themselves on the short end of another 1-0 pitchers’ duel, this time falling to Cherokee Bluff Wednesday at home in non-region action. East Jackson lost to Apalachee 1-0 back on Feb. 18.
Eagle coach Tedd Sims — whose team was coming off a 7-2 win over Cherokee Bluff Tuesday — called the close loss “a growing process.”
“It’s all about a process,” he said. “Doing the right things every night, playing the game hard every night, and if you get in a buzz saw like this and you come away with a 1-0 loss, you tip your hat to the other team.”
The Bears scored the lone run of Wednesday’s game with an RBI single from Jackson Kemp in the top of the sixth inning.
Cherokee Bluff starter Dylan Kautz threw five no-hit innings before East Jackson broke-up the no-hit bid in the sixth inning. Kautz allowed two hits and struck out 10 batters in six innings of work.
East Jackson starter Cole Sealey threw six innings, allowing four hits and one unearned run with five strikeouts, but was unable to finish out the game after injuring himself while throwing an off-speed pitch in the seventh inning.
“I just know he’s a tough competitor and he’s in a lot of pain,” Sims said. “It’s tough.”
Sealey possibly sustained an elbow injury to his throwing arm, but Sims didn’t want to speculate.
“He said it was his elbow, but I don’t want to jump to conclusions,” he said. “It could just potentially be a pulled muscle and that’s what I’m hoping for.”
Freshman Brayden Redding came on in relief of Sealey and threw a perfect seventh inning.
“I just told him, you never know when your shot is going to be called, and he went out there and got three-straight outs,” Sims said. “He did a great job. I’m proud of him.”
East Jackson missed its best chance to score in the fourth inning when it put runners on second and third with one out, and then later loaded the bases with two outs, but came away empty.
“We didn’t have the timely hit tonight that we had last night against these guys,” Sims said. “Coach (Jeremy) Kemp, he does a good job. We played college ball together, so we know one another very well, and I knew his guys were going to be ready to battle today. I wouldn’t expect anything less. We just competed and fought and battled and you tip your hat to them.”
Sims reiterated his concern for Sealey after the loss.
“Right now, my number one concern is Cole, and (we’ll) just see where we go,” he said.
The Eagles host Riverside Military Friday at 6 p.m.
•EAST JACKSON 7, CHEROKEE BLUFF 2 (TUESDAY): Prior to losing 1-0 on Wednesday, the Eagles went on the road Tuesday and scored four runs in the third inning and three in the sixth inning to pick up a win over Cherokee Bluff.
Halton Hardy threw a complete-game gem, allowing five hits and two runs with 10 strikeouts. He walked just one batter.
The Eagles finished with 14 hits.
Cole Sealey went 3-for-4 with a double, triple and an RBI. Jarrett Pursley went 3-for-4 as well with an RBI. Others with multi-hit games were Caleb Adair (2-for-3, RBI) and Josh Compton (2-for-4).

Grain elevators across the Prairies are jammed with the 2013 bumper crop. Ships heading for export markets are sitting empty at West Coast ports waiting for the grain to arrive.
Liberal MP Ralph Goodale says the government isn't doing enough to help move grain from Saskatchewan producers.
With millions of tonnes of grain stuck on the Canadian Prairies, the federal government is taking the rare step of ordering the railways to get the bumper crop moving or face stiff fines.
In Winnipeg, Transport Minister Lisa Raitt announced that a cabinet order issued Friday requires Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific to each move at least 500,000 tonnes of grain, or 5,500 rail cars, a week.
If the railways don’t comply, they could face fines of up to $100,000 a day.
“This issue affects more than just farmers, it affects trade and Canada’s ability to supply our markets around the world,” said Raitt, who was accompanied by Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz.

The order, good for 90 days, is renewable. It takes effect immediately, but the railways have four weeks to ramp up to the required levels.
“Canadian Pacific is disappointed with this unfortunate order-in-council,” said CP spokesman Ed Greenberg, arguing the move only raises more questions.
It “only focuses on the railways and not the entire supply chain,” he said in an email, noting that moving grain from farm to port is a complex system that needs to operate around the clock.
Canadian National spokesman Jim Feeny said the railway will do its part to move the grain, but emphasized co-operation is needed from grain growers and terminal staff, including a strong sales effort for grain shipments made out of Thunder Bay when Great Lakes shipping reopens in the spring.
“The federal government wants to play a role here,” Feeny said. “We’re going to need the federal government to encourage stakeholders, the farmers, the grain companies, the railways to act in a collaborative manner, as opposed to accusation and finger pointing.”
CN says it had already told the federal government that as soon as warmer weather arrives, it would ramp up to 5,500 carloads a week.
The move comes after farmers in Western Canada have complained that despite their best year ever, they can’t get their crops to market because the railways aren’t moving the grain. Further, farmers have complained that they are losing money as prices fall.
The 2013 yield was about 76 million tonnes — everything from wheat and canola to barley and lentils — up 33 per cent from 2012.
Grain elevators are jammed and individual farmers’ bins are full. Forty-three ships heading for export markets are sitting empty at West Coast ports waiting for the grain to arrive.
The railways say the extended, bitterly cold winter has forced them to slow operations, running short rail cars just to keep goods moving.
Over the past three months on the Prairies, there have been 49 days of temperatures below minus 25C, nearly double the usual average of 25 days.
In a full-page advertisement published Thursday in two national newspapers, CP CEO Hunter Harrison acknowledged service levels haven’t been met, but added winter is a factor.
“When the weather is this cold, we must take steps such as reducing train lengths to continue to move freight and ensure the safety of our employees and the communities in which we operate,” Harrison said.
While some groups have urged the railways to add more cars just to get the grain moving, Harrison said that would just create a bigger logjam.
“It is like adding more cars to a highway at rush hour — everything moves that much slower,” he said.
Wade Sobkowich, executive director of the Western Grain Elevator Association, which represents the grain companies, said during the best delivery week last fall, only 9,300 rail cars of grain moved.
“This will hold the rail companies accountable,” said Sobkowich, but warned that the backlog is so great, even at the government-ordered pace, one-third of the crop won’t get moved by late July, just as next year’s crop starts coming in.
“We’re so deep into this problem,” he said. “It doesn’t give enough capacity to move all of the grain.”
Sobkowich also questions whether the railway can put the blame on the cold weather, noting railways were told of the bumper crop in September.
“It’s like building a house without insulation and blaming winter when you are cold,” he said.
Ritz has promised that the government will introduce legislation to address more regulation in grain shipping.
CN’s Feeny argued more regulation is not needed, and any such move “is ill advised and counter productive,” because more regulation would lead to an “adversarial relationship within the supply chain at a time when collaboration is.",What action did the federal government take to address the issue of grain stuck on the Canadian Prairies?,"The federal government ordered the railways to move the bumper crop or face stiff fines.

2070,"Senator John Kerry keeps telling us that ""the rich"" need to pay more in taxes, and he proposes to raise the marginal tax rate that Americans with earnings in the two top tax brackets would pay. But the small amount that Kerry and his wife paid last year in taxes demonstrates the error of this approach. Under Kerry's own plan to ""tax the rich,"" his and his wife's average tax rate would increase to only 15.2 percent, far less than many small-business owners and middle-class earners would pay. This discrepancy is an artifact of today's convoluted tax code. In short, the Kerrys' own tax return makes the case for fundamental tax reform.
The Senator, for Example
Senator Kerry and his wife are among the 400 richest Americans. Last year, they paid only 13.4 percent of their declared $5.5 million income in federal taxes.
Estimates of the Kerrys' worth range from a low of $700 million to a high of $3.2 billion. How much income would you expect a billion dollars to produce? The Kerrys reported $5 million in income, which is a return of only about one-half of 1 percent, which is far lower than the return on even U.S. government securities.
How could this be? Like many wealthy Americans, the Kerrys have at their disposal a variety of legal means to keep income off of their tax returns and to keep the tax rate on their reported income low. Many of these loopholes are the result of tax policies that aim to reward or punish certain behavior with incentives and sanctions.
These policies make the tax code extremely complex, and their interactions and frequent vagueness benefit those with the means to employ extremely sophisticated tax-planning strategies. Conversely, this complexity disadvantages ordinary taxpayers, few of whom have the time or ability to navigate thousands of pages of tax code regulations, up-to-the-minute legal decisions, and administrative explanations and memoranda.
Kerry's running mate, Senator John Edwards, must have the same tax adviser. Last year, Senator and Mrs. Edwards paid an average tax rate of only 5.1 percent on their reported $434,000 of income, or less than one-third of the rate that the average taxpayer pays.
The Senator's Tax Plan
For those concerned about tax equity-that is, that all Americans pay their fair share in taxes-working within the confines of the existing tax system is extremely limiting. Raising marginal rates on the rich, for example, will not necessarily result in the super-rich paying markedly higher rates or even as much, as a percentage of actual income, as middle-class taxpayers.
So, in effect, any proposal to raise the top marginal rate is not really a proposal to increase taxes on those who are already rich, whether through inheritance, hard work, luck, or marriage, but a proposal to increase taxes on those who are trying to become rich. Those who have already achieved wealth, by whatever means, can tax shelter much of their income, but those with little in the way of assets find it almost impossible to shelter their earnings from taxes.
Senator Kerry's tax plan exemplifies this difficulty. Kerry proposes to raise the marginal tax rates that apply to income above $200,000. But what effect would this have on the actual taxes paid by the very wealthy? According to an analysis by the Argus Group, a respected tax law and economics firm, the Kerrys' average tax rate would only increase by 1.8 percentage points to 15.2 percent under the senator's plan. At the same time, many small-business owners would see their average rate rise by 4.0 percentage points, resulting in effective rates as high as 35 to 40 percent, including certain deduction phase-outs.
In other words, by proposing to raise the top marginal rates, Senator Kerry implicitly embraces a system of taxation under which he and his wife and other established, wealthy families pay an average tax rate that is less than half of what many young professionals and small-business owners, many of whom may possess few or no assets, have to pay. This fact should give any tax-equity advocate pause.
The Case for Fundamental Reform
No doubt unintentionally, Senator Kerry makes a strong case for fundamental tax reform, and specifically a flat tax or consumption tax.
Under a flat tax, all Americans, regardless of income level, pay the same percentage of their income in taxes. A flat tax minimizes the complexity of the tax code, eliminating the sort of loopholes that are today so valuable to those who can afford sophisticated tax planning.
Another option for tax reform is the consumption tax, under which savings and investment are excluded from income and only consumption is taxed. Economic efficiency would be enhanced because people would be taxed only on what they take out of the economy rather than on what they put into it.
Municipal bonds, a favorite investment tool of the wealthy, are already treated this way under the tax code, but few other investments are. As a result, most Americans investing their money are doubly taxed: once on their income and again on the investments that they make with that income. Just like the wealthy, all investors should be able to avoid double taxation.
In addition to promoting tax equity, a flat or consumption tax would stimulate an additional supply of labor and capital, which would result in much higher economic growth and lower unemployment to the benefit of all Americans.
As Senator Kerry's own experience so aptly demonstrates, today's tax code advantages the wealthy at the expense of those trying to better their lots. And as his proposal to raise taxes on the rich demonstrates, working within the confines of today's tax code is no way to fix the problem. Only a flat rate, whether under a flat income tax or a consumption tax, would ensure that all taxpayers-even the wealthy and even Senator and Mrs. Kerry-pay their fair share.

1530,"Sensors and actuators are taking the next evolutionary step and forming integrated systems
Smaller, cheaper, faster, cleaner, smarter. The demands in industry today are many. And only a combination of mechanics and electronics can deliver them. On a miniature scale, this combination is known as microelectromechanical systems or MEMS.
When MEMS technology first surfaced, it quickly grabbed the attention of the engineering community. Many thought it would be a short time before this technology affected almost everything. But it hasn't quite worked out that way.
MEMS-based sensors are progressing well from research and development to commercialization. They are often found in office products such as ink-jet printers and hard disk readwrite heads. In automotive applications, they're combined into systems containing micro-actuators and circuits to control the activation and deployment of almost all air bags. And in medical applications, they can be found in a host of devices from pacemakers to hearing aids.
MEMS-based actuators, however, have not made the transition from research to commercialization as quickly. Part of the reason lies with the difficulty in building MEMS engines with sufficient torque, and in joining tools to them. Another reason is the need for new fabrication techniques that permit batch production.
As researchers overcome these hurdles, actuators grow more commercially viable. In fact, new applications are beginning to appear, from microrobotics and noncontacting wafer transport systems to ultraprecise positioning.
The single state
Government research labs and facilities, such as the Microelectronics Development Laboratory at Sandia and Berkeley Sensor and Actuator Center (BSAC), have been instrumental in developing new fabrication approaches that boost torque and lessen the difficulty of connecting tools to MEMS devices. Some of the promising techniques include multilevel polysilicon micromachining and single-level polysilicon structures machined on CMOS substrates.
Polysilicon micromachining is a thin film process. Each material layer is four microns or less in thickness. Typically, layers of material are added to a substrate structure one at a time. Before the next layer is built, though, the previous layer undergoes any photoresist, exposure, and etching steps.
Until recently, microstructures usually used one layer of polysilicon. The latest sensors and actuators are built with four layers of this material and undergo eight or more masking steps in a process known as multi-level polysilicon micromachining. Three of the layers are movable polysilicon separated by layers of oxide.
For example, researches at Sandia Labs can make an electrostatic comb drive from one layer of mechanical polysilicon and a ground plane. With another layer of polysilicon, they can create a gear mechanism that rotates about a hub, as well as out-of-plane mirrors with hinges. By adding a third layer and ""planing"" away a sacrificial oxide layer, they were able to form linkages between actuators and output gears. These gears can rotate at speeds over 300,000 revolutions per minute.
The planing process, known as chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), is a type of annealing that is usually used on the upper layer of polysilicon on a structure. An abrasive slurry smoothes the polysilicon surfaces, both top and underside, removing excess features that would interfere with the movement of bearings and gears formed in other layers.
This process lets researchers create complex monolithic structures, such as interlocking gear trains and adaptive optical systems, that combine logic, drive, and signal processing electronics with micro-mechanical devices. Such devices are expected to replace the multi-chip format of past MEMS devices.
By combining these functions, today's MEMS devices possess intelligence and the capability to handle multiple tasks. An intelligent micromachine, for example, can signal for more power, indicate whether it's operating too fast or too slow, and automatically execute software routines. Such systems-on-chips include combination locks used to protect networking equipment, pop-up mirrors recently introduced for fiber-optic communication, and multi-axis accelerometers.
Researchers continue to experiment with additional layers of polysilicon, sacrificial oxide, and CMP steps. For example, with a fifth layer of polysilicon and a second CMP process, researchers created a gear train with moveable platforms.
A new union
The other MEMS processing technique, which combines polysilicon surface micromachining with CMOS, is being used to produce sensors and microelectronic control circuits on single-layer chips. By integrating control circuitry on a MEMS device, researchers can reduce parasitic noise associated with low-level stimuli at the interconnections.
Sandia's technique for combining CMOS and surface micromachining is to first make the MEMS components, then continue with conventional CMOS processing on the same wafer. The micro components are made in a trench etched into the wafer surface. Once done, the trench is backfilled with oxide as needed. The oxide bridge helps metal layers across the uneven surfaces of the two parts of the device.
Continue on Page 2
Using this method, BSAC developed an inertial measuring sensor that measures six degrees of freedom. It has a three-axis accelerometer and an XYZ gyroscope for navigation. The sensor measures less than 1 cm2. Other devices that use IC-based packaging include Hall and magnetoresistive sensors, and silicon accelerometers.
And many MEMS devices are still fabricated using more traditional techniques, such as LIGA. This German acronym roughly translates as lithography, electroplating, and molding. The fabrication steps include X-ray exposure of a resist material, plating, and then the removal of more resist until developers reach the desired microstructure.
Still to come
The remaining barriers to the expansion of MEMS include a lack of standard testing methods, a definition for acceptable reliability, standard packaging formats, and competition with existing technologies.
So far, testing equipment and methodologies have been specific to the developer of the micro device. Because each manufacturer tests for different attributes, it's often difficult to evaluate differences among various devices.
The same is true of performance measurements. There are no definitions that spell out minimum acceptable performance or reliability levels.
Most approaches to packaging are also company specific because they are seen as competitive advantages. This situation is especially prevalent with European developers. Apparently, the development community is waiting for users to set the standards.
Many interested parties, though, fear that the lack of agreement on size, height, and other form factors will retard industrial and commercial growth.
And lastly, work must still be done on linking micro devices to the macro ones we're all familiar with. So, although there's been progress, it may be a few more years before MEMS technology fulfills its initial promise.",What are some of the challenges in transitioning MEMS-based actuators from research to commercialization?,"Some of the challenges in transitioning MEMS-based actuators from research to commercialization include the difficulty in building MEMS engines with sufficient torque, and in joining tools to them.

1. Outrageous Misdirection on Massive Tree Destruction.
At the latest meeting of the fake neighborhood association, the head of the group was proud they were not destroying hundreds of trees around the building they tell people is the only thing they should be looking at.
He did not mention that the non stop propaganda of the organization is that it is anti Charles River to look at anything other than that building.
He and his buddies are fighting to destroy hundreds of trees along the Charles by telling folks not to look at anything other than that building which has not been used for 80 years. The destruction they are fighting for are hundreds of trees located between the BU and Longfellow Bridges. In addition, Governor Patrick’s House Bill H3332 with contains $24 million under the euphemism Historical Parkway is a spin off of lies of lovely underpasses under the next three bridges these folks have cooed about.
Part of their corrupt vote of April 23, 2013, supported part of the bike highway being funded by the $24 million which destroys those hundreds of trees.
They are also not walling off the Charles River, I hope, by yelling about that one building. They are, however, fighting to keep Magazine Beach walled off from the Charles by ordering people to look at nothing other than that one building.
The Machine’s explanation for the bizarre wall was incompetence of their friends. They insisted the Department of Conservation and Recreation was too incompetent to chop down their introduced bushes. The DCR is capable of chopping down bushes everywhere else, but not, according to that lie from the Machine, competent enough to chop down the bushes which created that wall.
The corrupt April 23 vote supported expansion of that “incompetence” and proved their “incompetence” lie just another lie. The corrupt vote of April 23 could double that bizarre wall.
The Machine is also not dumping poisons on the banks of the Charles River as part of that building. They are keeping those poisons in the playing fields by the nonstop pitch that it is anti Charles River to look at the problems of the Charles River. And they are calling their lies of anti-Charles River behavior just more lies by doubling the size of the area with poison usage by the corrupt vote of April 23.
They are also not heartlessly abusing the Charles River White Geese and other resident animals by that building. They are keeping the heartless abuse in play by telling people to look at nothing but that building.
Then there is the destruction of the parking lot for their beloved building, supported by the corrupt vote of April 23.
Word games, word games, word games. A lie is a lie is a lie. Word games are exactly that.
Very rotten people, but they, as is part of the game of the Cambridge Machine, yell about minutia and keep the massive destruction as secret as possible.

There are a whole bunch of bad faith maneuvers which are totally predictable, except it is not possible to tell which will be used next.
And they always are done indignantly, holier than thou.
And in exactly the same pattern of irresponsible behavior as the rest of their destructive friends.
The rotten behavior is because their goals are so rotten. They cannot achieve their goals through honorable behavior.

565,"If you are an overseas Pakistani or a foreigner thinking of traveling to Pakistan, be noted that Government of Pakistan has imposed regulatory taxes including Customs Duty on mobile phones entering Pakistan (more than one) that ranges up to 38% of the price of handset.
Fawad Chaudhry, Federal Minister for Information & Broadcasting, confirmed that overseas Pakistanis can bring their personal phones with them without having to pay taxes, however, they will be required to pay customs for additional phones.
He further stated that a cheap smartphone that costs about $50 will have a negligible tax but expensive phones will be taxed by as much as 38 percent of their listed valuation at Customs.
Meanwhile, Hammad Azhar, State Minister for Revenue, has also made it further clear by publishing a series of tweets mentioning that Overseas Pakistanis can also bring their personal phone to the country without any need of paying regulatory taxes. However, any additional phones that they will be carrying will need to be cleared from the Customs first.
Types of Duties and Taxes
The government has imposed various taxes on the import of mobile phones in Pakistan which include:
- Customs Duty
- Regulatory Duty
- Sales Tax
- Additional Sales Tax
- IT Duty
- Mobile Levy
- Provincial Tax
Mobile Phones’ Pricing and Customs Duty in Pakistan
The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has published a list of mobile phones covering 186 models released since 2016 with their corresponding prices and Duty rates. Pakistan Customs has also issued a valuation ruling for determination of values so that cell phones can be cleared in a speedy manner.
It is worth mentioning that the PTA has started blocking cell phones with unauthorized IMEI numbers from December 1, 2018, but those phones which entered Pakistan without proper customs clearance have been allowed to be cleared from PTA after payment of duties and taxes.

HERE’S THE ANSWER I FOUND FOR MY OWN QUESTION, ABOVE. The code below works in Notepad++ to select the first line found with ABC in it and the first line found after that with XYZ in it, and everything in between. (?-s)^.ABC(?s).?(?-s)XYZ.*\R. You have to un-check “. matches newlin” for it to work.
If ‘Replace’ is left empty the line before ABC and the line after XYZ become one. To keep them separate, do a Replace with a new line character. (Easy way to do that is simple copy the invisible new line character between adjacent lines of text in the doc you’re working with and paste it into the Replace field. You won’t see it there, but it is.) 'hope this is helpful for regexp newbies like me.
- Scott Sumner
Rather on relying on copying an invisible character into the replace field, simply do \r\n for a Windows line-ending file, or \n for a Unix line-ending file. Much easier to feel good that you’ve got what you intended in there.
Hello Jim,
I wrote this post, below, as a reply to Shayne Z., on the beginning of October :
As you spoke, in your post, of some particularities, about this reply, I just did some tests, again and I can’t see anything wrong !?
You have to un-check “. matches newline” for it to work.
Normally, you don’t have to bother about this option because I added, the modifiers
(?s)and
(?-s), on purpose, as these internal settings have PRIORITY on a possible .matches newline option, set by an user.
If ‘Replace’ is left empty the line before ABC and the line after XYZ become one
I can’t reproduce this behaviour. For instance, given the text, below :
12345 This line contains the ABC string Bla, bla, bla... This line contains the XYZ string 67890
and the S/R below :
SEARCH
(?-s)^.*ABC(?s).*?(?-s)XYZ.*(\R|\z)
REPLACE
NOTHING
I, as expected, got the text, after replacement :
12345 67890
But I may have forgotten something obvious ! So, just give me some examples which doesn’t behave as you would expect to. we’ll certainly find out the possible problems :-)
Best regards
guy038
Thanks Scott, for the newline tip.
Guy, I wanted to credit you for the search code in my original post but all I had here was the bare code in a .txt file, w/out any links to its origin, and it didn’t include the trailing |\z.
Glad you got me straightened out, and I really appreciate the code bit explanations you took the trouble to provide in your reply to Shayne Z in October.

Not everyone agrees with my opinions. You know what’s great about that? It’s ok! It’s ok if you don’t agree with me on something. You can say the most abhorrent thing ever, and I may not like it, but you can still say it. You have the freedom to voice your opinion. We all do, even if it’s not the popular thing to say in 2013.
I don’t watch Duck Dynasty and I don’t plan to. You may have heard a gentlemen from Double D was suspended for his remarks on homosexuality in GQ magazine (Can I ask what the hell GQ was doing interviewing him? He doesn’t exactly fit their demo, does he?).
Here is what he said: (This is from CNN need to say this again, I don’t agree with what he said, at all. It comes across as narrow-minded and uneducated. But it doesn’t matter, he can still say it, and he should be able to without fear of losing his job, or being suspended. (Aside; At least he didn’t say they would all burn in hell. I was once told that I would because I didn’t believe in God.)
People are saying he compared it to bestiality, I think that’s taking it a bit far. He also compared it to sleeping around with multiple women, and society says that is ok. A football player can talk about how many kids he has with different women, and no one does a thing about it. (See: Antonio Cromartie).
In this country, he can believe in God, he can think homosexual intercourse is disgusting, and he can voice his opinion on anything he wants. And please don’t’ say something like, “He is on TV, he has a certain responsibility.” What? Where were you when I had to see celebrity after celebrity endorse a presidential nominee that I did not support? Or when they thank God for winning an award?
Oh that’s right, it’s socially acceptable to think everyone believes the same thing. I’ve seen people go on tirades because the word God was almost removed from the pledge of allegiance. There are more people who want to remove the word Christ from Christmas.
Stop, it’s enough. There is never balance in this country. As soon as a good thing happens, we all band together and take it too far. Everyone becomes intolerant of something they don’t agree with. I hate saying this because I don’t want to admit it, but I think it’s the truth. Being in the public eye, and being in favor of gay marriage (which is a terrible term, it’s just marriage), has become the cool thing to do.
I end this with a quote, from a character created by Ricky Gervais. Gervais is a noted Atheist, and this is from his show Derek.

I think it’s a she that the support of equality (currently marriage equality) is becoming more trendy and less about discourse. There is so much awareness and understanding being lost as the knowledge of just why marriage equality matters becomes a yes or no opinion, and the issue gets simplified as the nuances and other related issues are left out in the cold.",What is the author's stance on freedom of speech and expression?,"The author believes that everyone has the freedom to voice their opinion, even if it's not popular or agreed upon by others.

403,"Apple announced the release of the highly anticipated tablet computer, called ""iPad"", and this was a red-letter day for Steve Jobs' world conquering company in two other ways.

- I hate upcoming production news, so let's get all the reboot movie and television news out of the way in one go:
* La Femme Nikita - It may be good, but just maybe. Jennifer Garner's Alias pretty much closed the book on female spy television. [SliceofSciFi]
* Planet of the Apes - This one just feels desperate, but the idea of doing a quasi-sequel telling the story of Cesar, the ape that led to the world of ""dang dirty apes"" might be worth seeing. [CHUD]
* Mortal Kombat - This movie sounds kinda cool, if they keep techno music.
- Michael Bay says Transformers 3 will feel ""very different"" from the other two, which means it will have a coherent plot and defined characters.

Multistage Networks
Figure 2.5:
Multistage interconnection network and an example
Shuffle-Exchange network (SEN).
Multistage interconnection networks (MINs) were introduced as a means to improve some of the limitations of the single bus system (to improve is the availability of only one single path) while keeping the cost within an affordable limit.
Such MINs provide a number of simultaneous paths between the processors and the memory modules (see Fig.
2.5
a).
A general MIN consists of a number of stages each consisting of a set of
switching elements. Stages are connected to each other using Inter-stage Connection (ISC) Pattern. These patterns may follow any of the routing functions such as Shuffle-Exchange, Butterfly, Cube, and so on.
Figure
2.5
b shows an example of an
MIN that uses the
SEs described before. This network is known in the literature as the Shuffle-Exchange network (SEN).
The figure shows how three simultaneous paths connecting the three pairs of input/output
,
, and
can be established. It should be noted that the interconnection pattern among stages follows the shuffle operation.
In MINs, the routing of a message from a given source to a given destination is based on the destination address (self-routing). There exist
stages in an
MIN.
The number of bits in any destination address in the network is
. Each bit in the destination address can be used to route the message through one stage. The destination address bits are scanned from left to right and the stages are traversed from left to right.
The first (most significant bit) is used to control the routing in the first stage; the next bit is used to control the routing in the next stage, and so on. The convention used in routing messages is that if the bit in the destination address controlling the routing in a given stage is 0, then the message is routed to the upper output of the switch. On the other hand if the bit is 1, the message is routed to the lower output of the switch.
Consider, for example, the routing of a message from source input 101 to destination output 011 in the
SEN shown in Figure
2.5
b. Since the first bit of the destination address is 0, therefore the message is first routed to the upper output of the switch in the first (leftmost) stage. Now, the next bit in the destination address is 1, thus the message is routed to the lower output of the switch in the middle stage. Finally, the last bit is 1, causing the message to be routed to the lower output in the switch in the last stage.
Figure 2.6:
Multistage interconnection network and an example
Shuffle-Exchange network (SEN).
The Banyan Network
; A number of other MINs exist, among these the Banyan network is well known (see Fig.
2.6
a, an example of an
Banyan network ).
If the number of inputs, for example, processors, in an MIN is N and the number of outputs, for example, memory modules, is N, the number of MIN stages is
and the number of SEs per stage is
, and hence the network complexity, measured in terms of the total number of SEs is
.
The time complexity, measured by the number of SEs along the path from input to output, is
. For example, in a
MIN, the length of the path from input to output is 4.
The total number of SEs in the network is usually taken as a measure for the total area of the network. The total area of a
MIN is 32 SEs.
The Omega Network;
The Omega Network represents another well-known type of MINs. A size N omega network consists of n (
single-stage) Shuffle-Exchange networks. Each stage consists of a column of N=2, two-input switching elements whose input is a shuffle connection. (Figure
2.6
b illustrates the case of an
Omega network.
As can be seen from the figure, the inputs to each stage follow the shuffle interconnection pattern. Notice that the connections are identical to those used in the
Shuffle-Exchange network (SEN) shown in Fig.
2.6
a.
Owing to its versatility, a number of university projects as well as commercial MINs have been built. These include the Texas Reconfigurable Array Computer (TRAC) at the University of Texas at Austin, the Cedar at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the RP3 at IBM, the Butterfly by BBN Laboratories, and the NYU Ultracomputer at New York University.
The NYU Ultracomputer is an experimental shared memory MIMD architecture that could have as many as 4096 processors connected through an Omega MIN to 4096 memory modules.
The MIN is an enhanced network that can combine two or more requests bound for the same memory address. The network interleaves consecutive memory addresses across the memory modules in order to reduce conflicts in accessing different data elements.
The switch nodes in the NYU Ultracomputer are provided with queues (queue lengths of 8 to 10 messages) to handle messages collision at the switch. The system achieves one-cycle processor to memory access.

(10.53 billion pounds).
Yahoo acknowledged that it was in talks with Alibaba, during its first-quarter earnings conference call with analysts last month. During the call, Thompson said the two companies were working on a ""simplified"" transaction to ""monetize"" a portion of Yahoo's stake in Alibaba.
To fund the deal, Alibaba would raise capital. The valuation that Alibaba receives in the fund-raising will determine how much Yahoo earns in the transaction, the source said.
In September, Alibaba was valued at $32 billion when Silver Lake and other firms invested in the company, according to media reports at the time. At that valuation, Yahoo could make $4.8 billion to $8 billion by selling 15 to 25 percent of Alibaba.
""Of all the previous ones we've worked on, this one feels like it might actually have a chance of getting done. Or at least it did until a day and a half ago,"" the person said, referring to the controversy around Thompson's resume.

528,"In vitro meat: Can we stomach it?
In vitro meat, also referred to as cultured meat, is a meat product grown from extracted cells in a factory. It's a test concept introduced by researchers to combat many ethical issues found in today's industrial livestock operations. The meat's production would also contribute to reduced environmental impacts, global hunger solutions, human health promotion and obesity reduction.\
Within the next 35 years, a process only in its beginning stages could become the norm, replacing most traditional livestock meat we find on grocery store shelves today.
Initially, it sounds like something from a futuristic science fiction novel or a dystopian society. Meat grown in a factory is straight from ""The Jetsons"" or ""Star Trek."" It's out of the question and couldn't even be possible, right? Wrong, completely wrong.
Cultured meat is happening right now. In fact, it has already happened. The first in vitro hamburger was served in 2013 in London. The two year project was highly complicated and not economically sustainable, with the final price totaling a hefty $325,000. But what did the lucky few selected to taste the burger have to say? Their biggest complaints were that the burger didn't taste the same as one that comes from grazing livestock, and it was a bit dry.
Despite the burger falling short on the taste and consistency fields, hopefuls still see the potential and are trying to obtain more funding for their research. If more support and funding is provided, the concept can become large scale, allowing the price to drop and more types of ""meat"" to be created.
I use the term ""create,"" but of course I must mention that many, if not most, creationists would be completely against not only the research, but the concept itself. Many believe that growing meat goes against what is natural. Creating meat in a test tube, adding our own flavoring, vitamins and additives would be overstepping our boundaries or even ""playing God."" There are even people who have gone as far as saying that it would be equivalent to serving up zombies on a plate.
It's buffoonery to go as far as calling the meat ""zombie production"", but how can the accusation be challenged when there are companies like BiteLabs arising? The company's basis is to produce salami made of tissue samples from celebrities. Gut reaction says that this is disturbing, and, more alarmingly, cannibalistic. But is it, really?
Challenging the traditional definition of cannibalism, it is decidedly not. The production and consumption of the salami would take place between two (or more, no judgement here) consensual adults. It would also fail to violate any U.S. laws against murder or body desecration. Maybe it's skin crawling and socially unacceptable, but I wouldn't go as far as to call it cannibalism. All Sweeney Todd jokes aside, if forced to use the word cannibalism, I'd say it is a form of ""humane cannibalism,"" if anything.
This argument presents a problem in itself, though. Since in vitro meat production is such a challenging and fairly newly researched topic there are many gray areas and questions posed that are difficult to answer because of how our society views the ideas of life, naturalism, cannibalism and humane treatment of animals. For in vitro meat to be a success, these terms must be redefined or at least understood in relation to factory grown meat.
Educational briefings and infographics would have to be readily available for the public, or they would simply not understand what it is they would be eating and would be against the meat replacement. If people aren't able to understand and accept that factory grown meat follows the same development process that meat from traditional livestock does, they will not back the introduction of the meat into the market.
Researchers behind the factory meat growing process also present the argument that in vitro meat would technically qualify as a vegan food. Part of this idea is because it would be cruelty free and a non GMO product.
The vegan-friendly argument is backed by PETA, who introduced a $1 million contest in 2008. The rules of the contest laid out that the company who was able to produce the first marketable in vitro chicken meat would receive the prize.
Unfortunately, no one was successful before the deadline arrived, and the prize money went towards combating animal cruelty in today's meat production process. PETA still considered the contest to be a raging success, though, based on the leaps and bounds made in the research and understanding of in vitro meat.
As someone who practices vegetarianism, I can see both sides of the argument. Yes, there would be cruelty-free meat available, which is a benefit that conquers a few issues vegetarians and vegans have with industrial livestock productions. It wouldn't offer a solution, though, to diehards who are not simply skipping out on meat products because they promote animal cruelty.
Some, such as Pennsylvania State University environmental resource management sophomore and environmental sustainability enthusiast Emily Newman, will not be supporting the endeavor, cruelty free or not.
When asked if she would ever find herself eating cultured meat, Newman, who has been a vegetarian for nearly two years and even practiced veganism for a brief period said, ""No, definitely not. Food comes from the ground. The earth is giving it to us. We can utilize it. That's it, no need for anything to be grown in a lab.""
Most vegetarians and vegans would hold the same standard. To suggest that cultured meat would be vegan friendly is to redefine the core values which people who practice a plant based diet hold themselves to.
I, however, am a big fan of the idea, not because I would find myself chowing down on some factory grown burgers or shoveling test tube bacon in my mouth, but because people who see meat as a necessity for every meal, the people who are hurting our environment and relishing in their poor health habits, will finally be able to contain their socially and environmentally poisonous behavior.
Personally, I'm still holding out for the real wave of the future- the Spy Kids' food Rehydrator, or the Star Trek Food Replicator. Until the glorious day comes when they're introduced, in vitro meat will have to do, and I'm looking forward to it's mass introduction, societal acceptance and growth within the next few decades.

Majik Box Rocket Fuel
Got a request for this one on the Facebook page. The original Rocket Fuel is an overdrive and a boost in one 1590BB enclosure. The overdrive side is essentially a Tube Screamer without any diodes, and the boost section is a straight MXR MicroAmp clone. The overdrive side is below and is laid it out for 9mm mini pots you can mount directly to the board from the solder side. If you build it without the boost daughter board, you can fit it in a 1590B.
There's also 3-position switch for changing the bass response. Use a DPDT on/off/on and wire it like this:

NN Classic Fuzz
Happy #FuzzFriday everybody! Here's a circuit I found while browsing around the Free Information Society that's ripe for modification–the NN Classic Fuzz. I think I laid this out while I was on paternity leave a while back, but I just now got around to finalizing the layout. Anyway, I can't find any info on the circuit, other than the schematic on FIS. It runs off a +4.5v supply, so I added a basic voltage divider to lower the normal +9v supply voltage. Also, the schematic doesn't include any controls, so if you want to add a volume pot (start with 100k, and then adjust if need be), run a wire from the Out pad to lug 3 of the pot, lug 2 becomes the new output, and lug 1 goes to ground. Should fit nicely in a 1590a.

Klon Centaur
Don't want to spend two grand on an original? Yeah, me neither. Regarded as one of the best overdrives of all time, the Klon Centaur seems to be something that every guitarist wants on their board. This one's not going to fit in a 1590B (if you want that, check out Madbean's Kingslayer), but you might have enough room in a 125B if you turn the board sideways. This layout follows the original Centaur with buffered bypass (using a DPDT footswitch). If you want to wire it for true bypass, ignore the footswitch wiring pads, and eliminate the 4.7µ cap, 560Ω and 100k resistors on the lower right side of the board near the input. Schematic and more info can be found here.
UPDATE:For those confused by the footswitch wiring for non-true bypass, here's a wiring diagram for reference.

JHS Little Black Buffer
Here's a simple buffer from JHS. It really only uses one side of the opamp (why not just use a TL071?) and the extra resistors on the other side are just to meet the manufacture's specs for an unused side. I couldn't find a schematic for this one, but drew one up from lvlark's vero layout. I've added polarity protection and extra power filtering to the layout.

This one is a silicon/germanium hybrid, using a BC337 silicon transistor for Q1 and a CV7112 germanium transistor for Q2 (but feel free to experiment with other transistors). I've laid this out for board mounted pots and the enclosure drilling template can be found here.

Run Off Groove Tube Reamer
Here's a simplified Tube Screamer circuit from Run Off Groove, the Tube Reamer. Basically, it's a buffer-less TS without the tone control. The IC can be just about any dual op-amp. JRC4558 or TL072 are good places to start. Should be a great candidate for a 1590a build. For more info, schematic, and demo see the ROG site.

BYOC Reverb 2
Got a request to make a layout for this schematic, and it turns out it's the BYOC Reverb 2. You can use 9mm pots and board mount them from the component side if you like. There are a few jumpers, though one of them (the one by the lower IC) can be eliminated if you just stretch out that 22k resistor. Also, the electrolytic caps are folded down on their side so things will fit with board mounted 9mm pots. The Belton BTDR-2H can also be board mounted from the solder side. Don't feel like making the board yourself? You can buy a PCB or a complete kit from BYOC..

Power Brick
Here's a little utility board that could come in handy. It uses a MAX1044 or ICL7660 to convert +9v to both +18v and -9v. It's essentially the charge pump from the Klon Centaur. I've added a 10v zenner (1N4740) diode to protect the IC, but that's optional.

1186,"Moving a 25 GB File From a Mac to a PC
(See updated item below and Corrections & Amplifications note at the end.)
Here are a few questions I’ve received recently from people like you, and my answers. I have edited and restated the questions a bit, for readability. This week my mailbox contained questions about moving a 25 gigabyte file from a Mac to a PC, switching the iPhone to horizontal mode, and enlarging font size.
How can I move a 25 gigabyte file from a Mac to a PC?
If the two computers are on the same network, you could simply transfer the file over the network. Or, you could establish an ad hoc network using what’s called a “crossover” network cable, though that might require some technical expertise. You might also try uploading the file from the Mac to one of the online backup-and-storage services and then downloading it to the PC. For instance, a service called MediaMax, at mediamax.com, offers 25 gigabytes of storage free, and claims to work with both Macs and PCs.
For the best combination of simplicity and speed, I suggest you purchase an external USB hard drive, formatted for Windows. The Mac should be able to instantly recognize it, since Macs can read Windows disks and can write to them as well, as long as they use a standard Windows format called FAT. You would just plug the drive into the Mac, copy the file to it, then remove it from the Mac, plug it into the PC and copy the file from the external drive to the PC’s internal hard disk. Update: Due to technical limitations, you can’t copy a file larger than four gigabytes in size to a disk drive formatted using the FAT file system.
A 30-gigabyte or larger Apple iPod can also be used as an external hard disk and thus would do the trick — provided it is formatted for Windows, is set to work in disk mode, and has enough room to hold the file.
Is it possible to switch the iPhone into horizontal mode when typing emails, which would allow for wider spacing on the onscreen keyboard when typing, thus helping to eliminate typing errors?
No. While the iPhone’s Web browser, built-in iPod and photo program can operate in landscape, or horizontal, mode, its email program works only in vertical, or portrait, mode. However, in my daily experience with the iPhone, I have actually found the horizontal version of the keyboard (which appears in the browser) clumsier to use than the narrower vertical version.
My grandmother, age 85, recently stopped our weekly emails and when I asked why, she said the 14″ screen has become difficult to use. I considered a 20″ LCD, but the bigger screens seem to shrink the font, and the Magnifier option under Accessibility isn’t agreeable to her. What other options are there?
I assume from your question that she is running Windows XP. If so, you can enlarge the fonts she uses in several ways, to offset the shrinkage you noted on the higher-resolution monitor. First, in Windows itself, go to the Display control panel, click on the Appearance tab, and in the Font Size menu, select “Extra Large Fonts.”
Most email programs and Web browsers also offer options to enlarge the size of text. For instance, in Outlook Express, go to Tools, then Options, then click on the Read tab and the Fonts button. Change the Font Size setting to “largest.” In the Compose tab, click the “Font Settings” button and select a large font size. While reading an email, she can increase the font size by clicking on the View menu, selecting “Text Size,” and then selecting “Largest.” There is a similar “Text Size” setting in Internet Explorer, under either the View or Page menu, depending on which version she is using.
Finally, if she is reading her email inside Internet Explorer, you might try a very good $25 utility called WebEyes, which enlarges the type on any Web page. I tested it in 2004 and liked it (Read the review). You can get it at.

Corrections & Amplifications:
Due to technical limitations, an individual can’t copy a file larger than four gigabytes in size to a disk drive formatted using the Windows file system called FAT. A previous version of this column incorrectly advised that a 25-gigabyte file could be copied to such a disk drive.
Just for the record, I just copied 25 gigs from my desktop HDD to an external I use with my laptop. I used Firewire 400, 30 minutes and done. Firewire 400 is a tad slower than USB2.0.
I think that this is way faster than ethernet over my network.Posted by Richard Mitnick at August 3rd, 2007 at 11:51 am
You could of used gigabyte ethernet as most new Macs come with it. And also it is quite cheap for a network pci card.Posted by Dean Chester at August 4th, 2007 at 5:06 pm
Your article misses a very important point. FAT32 file format does not allow files bigger than 4G. NTFS file system is not compatible with macintosh and the Mac HPFS is not compatible with Windows. An external hard drive can not be used to move files larger than 4G.Posted by David Husch at August 8th, 2007 at 4:27 am
After reading Walt’s column and these comments I wanted to clarify what is actually needed to transfer files between Macs and PCs. If you already own an external HD of any type, you can simply use the Mac Disk Utilty to format the drive as MS-Dos format and you will then be able to transfer files between both platforms. No need to purchase MacDrive. You can format and read/write to any size volume. I have successfully done this with a 2TB LaCie drive.Posted by Chris Plapp at August 10th, 2007 at 3:33 pm",What are some methods to move a 25 gigabyte file from a Mac to a PC?,"Some methods to move a 25 gigabyte file from a Mac to a PC include transferring the file over the network if the two computers are on the same network, establishing an ad hoc network using a crossover network cable, uploading the file from the Mac to an online backup-and-storage service and then downloading it to the PC, or using an external USB hard drive formatted for Windows.

742,"- This is a guest blog post by Bonnie Joy Dewkett about Time Management Tips for Businesses -
Small business owners are often responsible for lots of things; administrative work, marketing efforts and management of the company. It’s a lot to handle and a lot of things to get done each day. Often, business owners end up focusing on all of the small details and the big projects and development work goes undone. By really determining where and how you spend your time, you can make sure you are making the best of it. By maximizing your time, you are making your life less stressful and allowing your business to grow.
1# Write everything down. Getting things out of your head and into a productivity app is helpful in reducing mind clutter. Something as simple as free note taking program can be divided into different sections and easily carried around with you.
2# Keep lists, and have more than one. A productivity app works great for this..
3#.
4# Determine how you prioritize. Some people like to do what is most difficult first in their day. Others want to do what could make them the most money first in the day. Pick a way to prioritize and stick with it.
5# Schedule time for email as the Internet can be a huge time waster..
6# Delegate everything you can. If you have an assistant, and you are doing your own filing, that’s not an effective use of your time. Find out what can be done by others and pass it off to them. A little time training someone goes a long way in freeing up your day.
7# Schedule time for making proactive phone calls, and returning calls you’ve received. Playing phone tag can use up a lot of time and can decrease your productivity. Schedule telephone calls with your other party so that you both know when you will be available to chat. Bundle your phone calls all at once so that you are not being disrupted from your work more than one time.
8# Go to meetings or make phone calls with an agenda and questions. Know what you WANT and NEED to accomplish during your call or meeting. Having no schedule or agenda allows other topics to creep in, wasting your valuable time.
9# location, even if it is just within your office.
10# Prepare for tomorrow today. By cleaning off your desk today, and making a list of things you should accomplish first thing tomorrow, you allow yourself to have focus when you first arrive at the office the next day. We are often foggy in the morning, which makes us unsure of where to begin working for the day. When you don’t know where to begin, you delay the entire day. Writing your to-do list before you leave for the day also clears your mind so that you can rest, relax, and get a good night’s sleep when you get home.
Running a small business is always challenging! There are never enough resources: time, space, and money in particular. Learning to maximize what you have is important, and can mean the difference between success and failure. Often, we simply need to change the way we are looking at things and how we are managing our time. By freeing up time, we can focus on things that are important to the success of the business, such as social media marketing. While social media marketing does not cost anything to use, the time invested must come from somewhere. By learning how to “create” time in our already busy days, you can add in social media marketing to your day and grow the success of your company.

331,"Early this year, there was a buzz on Motorola inviting T-Mobile Moto X owners to take part in a soak test for possible future update. Motorola seemed skeptical in disclosing facts at that point of time but since Moto G was recently upgraded to Android 4.4.2; enthusiasts anticipated the same for T-Mobile Moto X. And it turned out to be true.
News Update
This T-Mobile version of Moto X is now receiving the upgrade which is a file size of 147.6 MB. The Android 4.4.2 is the latest version of KitKat that includes all the goodies from the earlier installments, plus a few additions. The good news is, Motorola has customized the whole package and made a few tweaks into the update. The Software Version bumped to 161.44.25 and the notable changes are listed as below:
- It added substantial support for services like printing photos, Google Docs, Gmail messages and other such content via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and hosted services such as HP ePrinters and Google Cloud Print.
- It fixed all the bugs identified during the preliminary runs, including the ones that caused a few users to experience short battery life after upgrading to KitKat.
- Another bug that caused delays in synchronizing email services like Microsoft Exchange was resolved, thus adding to the convenience of the user.
This is a noteworthy upgrade, considering the fact that bugs and errors were fixed. Mobile addicts across the world will rejoice, for they can experience the smartness of Android KitKat flawlessly in their devices. This is significant development in terms of update.
This variant is an unlocked GSM device so chances are, you can use it on networks of other service providers. In all probability, the update should not be affected and the installation should hardly take much time. The T-Mobile Moto X Android update is now available for manual download. It is accessible in the following sequential way:
- Click on Settings
- Click on About Phone
- Click on System Updates
- Click on Download
Recommendations
For ensuring a successful installation, it is highly recommended to install this update with at least 50% battery and a strong connectivity; preferably Wi-Fi. Follow the notification message and select download-> once the download is over, select Install-> Once the installation is over, and the phone will automatically restart. This marks the completion of the installation process. The phone is now updated to 161.44.25 – This build is same as the soak test.
This upgrade is free in the carrier network and Motorola and Google has collaborated for a back up service for those in trouble. In case of distress, a user can contact them through the Moto X web interface and avail the service. There is still no news on other carrier variants of this update but we can safely hope that it will roll out very soon. Though the upgrade doesn’t appeal in terms of version number but it is definitely significant for users to live with the latest KitKat.",What are some of the notable changes in the T-Mobile Moto X update?,"The notable changes in the T-Mobile Moto X update include substantial support for services like printing photos, Google Docs, Gmail messages and other content via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and hosted services such as HP ePrinters and Google Cloud Print.

1018,"I have!
In year 9, my second year of high school I moved ‘groups’. High school always had groups, you would talk to the people that sat next to you in class but at recess and lunch you would congregate with your own group. Well I left one group to hang out with another, upon moving to this group there was one girl who didn’t immediately click with me. There was a jealous behaviour between the two of us, which I later discovered was because the guy, Brenton Mountford, who I dated in year 8 (dated as in held hands and walked to classes together for all of a few weeks), was her boyfriend throughout year 7. OOPS!
This girl along with her Mum and two sisters moved to a rental house a very short walk from where I lived, I remember the day that some of us decided to meet up and we walked to her house to see if she wanted to join us, we then walked back to my house and upon this walk was where we really first spoke to each other. We laughed at the fact that she was upset about a lost love.
From this day on, we grew closer and closer together.
She was going through a difficult time as her parents had just separated and I was there for her when she felt alone. We would write letters to each other, borrow each other’s clothes, have long phone calls after spending the day at school together, we even worked together at the local deli. I was there for her when she decided to run away from her Mums to live with her Dad, a decision which upset me as she was no longer within walking distance to me.
Year 11 Rivercruise
Our workplace is where our lives changed forever. The owners of the deli had two young sons, one a year older than us and another two years. After months of flirting I started dating one of the sons, me 15, and him 16. Soon after, one of his friends started dating my friend.
With this, we formed friendships with the amazing group of friends that these guys had.
Each Friday night I would stay with her at her Dad’s house, a 25 minute drive from home, we would be at parties, attempting to be let into pubs, we thought we were so much older than what we were.
We were by each other’s side each time one of us fought with our boyfriends, we covered for each other and above all, we never tired of each other’s company.
Six and a half months later my boyfriend and I ended things, it was tough at first but I continued to work for his parents therefore I saw him almost every day. His Dad had been diagnosed with cancer, he needed to be there for him and his Mum. I respected that.
With my girlfriend still seeing his friend therefore still spending each weekend with his group of friends and not with me, cracks started to show.
I resented the fact that she was choosing them over me, that she was still having fun with them and I felt too uncomfortable to be around them as often as she was.
We remained friends but I knew it wasn’t the same. I left school at the end of year 11 forcing our friendship to strain that little bit more, no longer were we with each other every single day.
I remember her 18th birthday, she was now dating a new guy and we all went clubbing together, I was still 17, I had just got my licence so I offered to drive, I always managed to get into places with my sisters ID. I remember dancing on a podium (yes, I rocked it out back in the day) and all I could notice was how close she seemed to everyone else there that night except for me.
Over the course of the next couple of years we drifted even further apart, and by drifted I mean the phone calls and catch ups completely came to a screeching halt.
I had a serious relationship, broke up with said serious boyfriend, went through hell with my sisters illness, moved out of home and met my now hubby all without her by my side.
In August of 2007 we were at the same 21st. Not one word was spoken. She left. I sent her a text. Yep, still remembered her number off by heart, she replied.
I remember the feeling like I had just heard back from a guy that I really, really liked. There were butterflies.
We were going to be at another 21st together in October, 2 months later. We emailed and chatted over the course of these 2 months and in October of 2007 our friendship began again.
Over the last 4 years, we have supported each other through home building, home renovating, a wedding, a baby, sister drama’s, job changes, and now an engagement.
Us at my wedding.
With our beautiful friends in Melbourne - girls weekend away.
Last weekend saw my gorgeous girlfriend in her happiest moment. She was celebrating her engagement to her boyfriend of 7 years. I was so happy to be there for her, she looked incredible and I can’t wait to see what the next 4 years brings for us.

Today, businesses and individual potential customers look up the internet before they decide to deal with you. Everyone desires to make sure that they are dealing with genuine people. This is the reason why the reputation of your online business must be protected.
Research studies have reported that 80% of clients are persuaded by suggestions displayed on social platform regarding products and services, and only 14% believe in advertisements. Internet has fetched plenty of freedom for spreading of information instantly and globally. Those people having grudges can be heard all around the world, without media getting involved. Issues regarding brands are taken notice of not just in your own market niche, but also across the country.
Media stories may not be always true, but remember false information spread faster than truth, which has the potential to damage your brand reputation. From a purely financial viewpoint, good reputation assists you in getting more clients which will help you in making money and growing influence. It is something tangible, to be proud of and feel good.
Online business either small or big needs to get recognition far and wide. So many businesses are applying online reputation management strategies to protect their brand name. This aspect needs to be considered closely, assuming that you may have heard or read about reputation issues. When users search your name, they will be presented with your entire data, but are you sure about the accuracy of such representations? Does it accurately say who and what you are? Is that information obsolete? Are you regarded with the same credibility as your peers? How does their status weigh against yours?
These days, a recording of stupidity on smartphones can hang around incessantly on the net. For example, if an employee can get careless, say something wrong, the recording will be visible on search engines ceaselessly. If you are building a reputation either personally or related to your business, then you will need to involve in taking care of it and protecting it, if necessary.
Important steps to monitor as well as defend your brand and reputation
- Step1 – Gain knowledge on how social media podiums work. Understand how to use popular media like FaceBook, YouTube, Twitter and MySpace. Get familiar with these platforms by reading their terms and conditions. Take some time to watch and recognize how people are making use of these social media channels.
- Step2 – Social media has not just thousands but millions of users, so do not assume that it will not damage your name. Users might comprise of your clients, who are columnists, public figures, influencers, and bloggers. These people are tweeting about companies. Maybe about yours? It becomes necessary to find out if their chat is positive or negative for you or your business.
- Step3 – Be proactive to defend your trademark. You can do this in several ways. First register your trade name with different social media channels. In this manner, your brand is saved from getting skyjacked by an unknown person.
- Step4 – Create a plan for your company that notifies and educates the staff. The company policy will have guidelines of how to use social media – what to say and what not to discuss, when it is about the company. In addition, the company policy must include a backup plan to follow, especially in case of crisis.
- Step5 – Be alert. Monitor social platforms regularly. Ignorance is not forgiven. It is vital to know, when someone is chatting about you and your brand – Be it good, bad or ugly.
- Step6 – Sometimes things written about you or your business may be negative but embrace it, when considered necessary. The social media platforms are the places where discussions regarding the situation are done in public, so be willing to accept the negative conversations. It will give you better integrity with other clients.
Free monitoring tools:
- Google Alerts – Google alerts you, when you come in search, or if your brand is mentioned on Google News, Videos, Search engines, and Groups.
- Twitter – Search tool available on Twitter displays, what is tweeted that resembles your search inquiry.
- Monitor This – Monitor-This keeps watch on more than 20 search engine feeds.
- Technorati – This tool notifies if your brand is mentioned in Blogosphere.
Social media offers plenty of marketing benefits like creating awareness and testimonials. However, it is necessary to remain cautious towards your reputation and trademark. If you do not have the time, then consider outsourcing the job before deceptive activities actually wipe away your marketing investments – corrodes the brand and reputation as well as ruptures your customer trust.

1257,"Diana Krall at the Nac: Over production is a concert spoiler
Reviewed by Iris Winston
February 26, 2013 Tuesday at 9:57 am.
The other disappointment in the presentation is Krall’s somewhat awkward and weak patter between numbers. At one point on Sunday night, she said, “I know, shut up and sing.” Pity that she didn’t take her own advice sooner because there is no question that she is at her best when singing and playing.
The highlight of the show for me was her rendition of Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter. This was a reminder of the simple and intimate concert she gave in the Studio Theatre during her first appearance at the National Arts Centre.
The current Glad Rag Doll tour, which features jazz standards of 80 and 90 years ago, is being touted as Krall’s return to her musical roots. Terrific. So let her return without distracting over production. The quality of her music and the excellent musicianship of her quintet definitely doesn’t need this kind of “help.”",What was the highlight of the show for the reviewer?,"The highlight of the show for the reviewer was Diana Krall's rendition of ""Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter""."
1452,"This morning was a bright and cheery one!
I did not realize how much I took sunshine for granted until I moved from Florida to Michigan. Everyone keeps telling me that the summers here are sunny and beautiful, and I cannot wait for it to get here already.
For the first time in ages, Roadie and I both had shadows during our morning walk around the neighborhood. I took full advantage of the “warm” weather and made an extra lap around our block to soak it in.
I know Roadie loved it too, because upon our return it looked as though he was actually smiling.
While living down south, I really enjoyed my morning and afternoon walks with him outside. It was my little escape and excuse to get out and enjoy some fresh air. I am keeping my fingers crossed that as the days go by the temperature only goes up from here!
Breakfast
Today’s coffee time also made me smile. For some reason, I felt like grabbing an old throwback mug from the breakfast place I used to work at.
I miss that food something terrible! While dancing in Orlando, I worked as a waitress for First Watch Restaurants for three years, and I am not exaggerating when I say I ate their food at least once if not twice a shift.
It is that delicious!
There are locations nationwide, but none of them have traveled up to Michigan quite yet. I am counting down the days (28!) until I make my visit home to Florida, and you better believe I will be stopping at a First Watch the first opportunity I get.
Until then, I do my best to remember the kind of food I used to order. Egg beater breakfast scrambles were certainly an everyday favorite!
Today I made one with egg beaters, spinach, mushrooms, onions, and feta cheese.
I sided it with a MorningStar Farms Veggie Sausage Pattie and a slice of whole wheat toast smeared in peanut butter.
Unless I was opening, I would come a half an hour early every shift and order something very similar before a long day of work. Yummy!
Five Funny Things I Do Every Day
This morning I got a bit of a giggle from fellow healthy living blogger, Janice. Today she shared 5 Crazy Things She Does when she thinks no one is looking, and I could relate to the majority of her list.
While on my walk this morning I kept thinking of some pretty funny things I do on a daily basis. Some are subconscious habits, and most are just plain weird. Every one, however, would embarrass me if I knew someone was watching me while doing them. So… why not embarrass myself a little and share them with you? 😉
1. While sitting down for any period of time (mostly at the computer), I am constantly moving. I am either tapping my leg, chewing on my lip, or playing with the backs of my earrings.
2. I jam out to at least one slow jam favorite a day in the car. (Really… does anyone not do that?) Lately my go-to is Give Me Love by Ed Sheeran.
(Coolest music video I’ve seen in a while, by the way.)
3. When I need to study or concentrate on something, my mind quickly wanders. I will often zone out and sometimes even interlock my fingers, then move them up and down. When I finally realize what I am doing, I immediately stop. It is the weirdest thing in the world, and Scott thinks it’s hilarious when he catches me do it!
4. When I clean any type of surface or put on mascara my mouth instantly opens, and occasionally my tongue will sneak out! It’s so awkward.
5. I am a serious speed walker. I hate feeling like I am stuck behind someone on a sidewalk, at the mall, and especially at the airport. Ninety-nine percent of the time I am not trying to work out, but just prefer to get places faster. Guess I’m a little impatient?! lol.
And now you can officially make fun of me. I think it’s funny too!
Questions of the Day
I would love to see if any of you can relate to any of these.
• What are some funny/weird things you do every day?
• Are most “embarrassing” things you do usually subconscious or just by habit?
I’m a speed walker too. I can’t stand when people stroll everywhere!
Maybe it’s a runner thing? lol.
I have your back on the speed walking. I thought it was just a Chicago “fast paced” thing I picked up, but I can’t stand slow walkers!
My sister and I also have the “Schneider” blink (we named/made up)which means our left eye blinks faster than our right, and if you time it juuuust right, you can catch it in a photo and we look, well, special. haha
HAHA. That sounds amazing! You and your sister sound very special (and awesome!) 😉
I’m from Tampa!! I miss First Watch too! Those banana crunch pancakes were a treat–and loved my egg wihite omelet with fruit
Ohhhh my gosh, hands down Banana Crunch pancake with chocolate chips was my favorite way to splurge there. SOOO GOOD! 🙂",Where did the person move from and to?,The person moved from Florida to Michigan.
671,"Allowing myself this acculturation period has actually been very beneficial for me and my long term goals. The new school term began on January 4, and at this time I was ready to introduce two new projects to Saint Paul's Primary School based on what I have observed, and how I felt I could best be of service. The first is in conjunction with the community organization I am paired with, St.Paul's Family Initiative. It is a literacy project that aims to promote family bonding through reading. Basically I spend a couple of hours each week in the classrooms doing an interactive story hour. Sometimes I read to the students, sometimes they read to me or to each other. I ask question and hold discussion to check for comprehension, and the kids really enjoy the books! I then encourage them to keep reading at home by facilitating library check-outs. Each week they get a book to take home and read with their parents, and when they bring the books back to class, I give them a chance to tell us about the story. They are always a little shy at first, but the promise of stickers always helps to loosen them up a bit. Yeah I am totally not beyond bribing the kids to read :-). Friends and family back home have even gotten involved with my reading project, and started a MUCH NEEDED book drive! My Mom and sisters have put their passions (read Panama blog) to great use and have rallied there friends and neighbors to donate old children's books to the students at St.Paul's primary school. I am so please and proud of everyone for helping me out and making this contribution to my kids. THANKS GUYS!
The second project I introduced this month is one that is really near and dear to me, definitely my pet project. It's an after school girls group, and I feel so strongly about it, that it is difficult for me to articulate why I think it is so important, but I just know that it is. I started this group at two different campuses, with the idea that I could provide these young women with a safe and healthy environment in which to explore issues that are specific to them. Our projects will focus on body image, leadership skills, dating & sex, challenges at home, goal building, health & wellness, etc. I also set aside time each week for reading or doing homework, trying always to reiterate to the girls the importance of education. So far the group has been very well received, the girls at each campus are really taking ownership of it. At St.Paul's they have chosen to name themselves The Precious Girls Club, and at Newton Ground they are the Girls Friendship Club. Both groups are still in their infancy stages, but I am REALLY REALLY exited to see each them grow. Here are some photos from this weeks' activities:
St.Paul's ""Precious Girls Club,"" fitness hike. The girls and I took a walk to our local beach. Initially I told them no swimming, but come on, you can't take kids to the coast and expect them to stay dry. As soon as they hit the sand, the threw off their uniforms and jumped in. In one photo, you can see me yelling, ""ok, but only 5 minutes!""
Newton Ground Primary """"Girls Friendship Club,"" working quietly and productively during homework hour. Don't let them fool, they do not always act so sweet!",What are the two new projects introduced at Saint Paul's Primary School?,"The two new projects introduced at Saint Paul's Primary School are a literacy project in conjunction with St.Paul's Family Initiative that promotes family bonding through reading, and an after school girls group that provides a safe and healthy environment for young women to explore issues specific to them."
612,"As a woman with chronic pain, you look for ways to soothe yourself physically and mentally, right? Well color is one of my favorite tools when designing homes for women with arthritis but if it’s used incorrectly it can be as much hindrance as help. There are thousands upon thousands of paint colors which can be both a blessing and a curse.
Arthritis is a heat generating illness. When choosing paint for your home, you want pale, cool and slightly muted colors. Keep color contrasts to a minimum and remember to consider trims and wood finishes in your overall color schemes.
Use flat finishes in your living room, dining room, entry and bedrooms; velvet or eggshell in the kitchen and bathrooms (these soft, semi washable finishes are appropriate for most surfaces), satin which is washable and stain resistant, is good for high traffic areas like hallways and kids’ rooms, and semi-gloss on doors, trim, molding and cabinetry. Gloss is also good for cabinetry, doors, trim and molding but make sure your surface is in excellent condition because gloss shows every imperfection. Gloss is also highly washable.
Dunn Edwards
I worked with an extraordinary color expert Marie Brown, LEED AP ID + C at my local Dunn Edwards to come up with these beautiful colors. Dunn Edwards paint colors are often preferred by interior designers. They are quality paints with a more affordable price per gallon than Pratt and Lambert.
Winter Morn DET 617, light gray
Silver Setting DE 6359, a versatile, complex, light gray (gorgeous on my new kitchen and bath cabinets!)
Porpoise DE 6373, one of DE’s most popular light grays
Miner’s Dust DEC 786, DE’s most popular medium gray beige (this “greige” is a little darker, and would be lovely in a powder room)
Fine Grain DE 6213, a light gray, that is at once cool and warm.
Clear Vision DE 5875, pale blue
Polar Ice DE 5798, pale blue
Morning Mist DEW 388, pale blue
Mist Spirit DE 6302, pale celadon
Lightning Bolt DE 6295, pale celadon
Windy Sky DE 6288, pale celadon
Cool Frost DE 5931, soft lavender
Whisper DEW 340, one of DE’s most popular whites and with good reason
White Picket Fence DET 648, another of DE’s most popular whites
Cool December DEW 383, white
Foggy Day DE 6226, taupe-gray (Greige)
Pratt and Lambert
One of my favorite paint companies is a boutique company called Pratt and Lambert. Their colorist Cynthia and I devised these color selections just for you! They are pale, soft and cooling, just what you need to soothe pain and cool your inflammation.
What I love about Pratt and Lambert is that their pigment content is high, giving their paint much more depth and complexity than the others. I prefer their top of line, Accolades formula.
Some paint companies change, discontinue and add to their formulas so whatever company you go with, always ask for their current, premium paint formulation. Be willing to pay the extra money for it and it will not only look stunningly beautiful, it also won’t need to be repainted for at least ten years. My Pratt and Lambert paints at last count are eight years old and I still sigh when I walk in my home. High quality paints have depth, character, better coverage, are easier to clean, last longer, have fewer toxins and are easier on the home’s inhabitants and the environment in general. Those represent considerable value, even if you pay $20 more per gallon.
Cynthia at Pratt and Lambert was kind enough to help me choose some beautiful paint colors for you.
Chanteuse 25-27 is a beautiful pale blue green.
Chervil 22-30 is a pale celadon.
Hare 2-31 is a soft lavender.
Summer Sky 22-31 is a soft gray-green.
Phantom 11-31 (my living room, entry, dining room, stairwell and halls are Phantom in Pratt and Lambert’s Accolades flat finish and it’s giving me years of sigh inducing, visual pleasure, every time I come home!)
Smokestain Rose 3-1, a muted rose
Half and Half 7-2, white
My other favorite is Half and Half, a creamy white with skin flattering undertones, perfect for the master bedroom, bathrooms and dressing room. My master bedroom is painted in the flat Accolades Half and Half and also the doors, crown molding, and base molding. It is quite frankly the most beautiful creamy white I’ve ever come across. How often do you actually notice white? Well this one is impossible to ignore.
How to Test Paint
Buy a small amount and paint it on two 8 x 10 pieces of paperboard. Test the color by holding the papers up or taping them close together, wrapped around a corner, opposite the windows. Test in multiple spots during different times of the day. Look at them against plain white paper, and look at many different, yet similar colors side by side to get an accurate idea about each color.
Choosing Trims and Ceilings
This next part is a bit more advanced than what we’ve been talking about so far. If you have crown molding, choosing ceiling paint is quite a bit easier. But if you don’t, my choices below are the solution.
Use the whites for ceilings. Use a flat finish. Also use these whites for cabinets, doors and trim, in a semi-gloss or gloss finish, but only if your surfaces are in excellent condition.
Choosing dark accent walls is problematic. Though painters are willing to “cut in” paint color changes from wall to ceiling it never looks professional when there is a noticeable color contrast without crown molding to divide it. To be honest, I never liked the accent wall look to begin with. It looks great in Starbucks and other commercial applications but not in residences, and particularly not in today’s residences where the open floor plan is so prevalent. With all pale wall and ceiling colors there is little color contrast so you can go with a white ceiling if you like or even match the ceiling to the wall color. As long as they are soft and pale like the colors I’ve chosen for you below (with the exception of Miner’s Dust), the magnifying effect of colors bouncing off one another will be minimal.

05/06/2017
Year 7 spent most of last week in Normandy, exercising their French and learning about William the Conqueror and the D-Day landings. One of the pupils, Edward R. had this account for us:
Year 7 left school mid-morning on Monday to go to Portsmouth to catch the ferry. We were all very excited as some of us had never been on a ferry before. There was lots of entertainment on the ferry, the highlight being the limbo competition which was won by Jack R. and Tasmin J. We arrived at the hotel late in the evening and went to bed ready for our exciting week ahead.
After a continental breakfast, we visited the 360⁰ cinema at Arromanches. We experienced the true scenes of war during this very humbling film. The cinema was followed by two different activities. We split into our activity groups; half of us made and ate biscuits at the Biscuiterie, whilst the other half explored the town with a quiz (Eliza’s group got lost). The afternoon’s activities involved visiting the war cemetery in Bayeux which touched the hearts of many. We laid a wreath from Clayesmore on the graves of unknown servicemen. Shortly after, we visited the mighty Bayeux Tapestry. Everyone enjoyed the storytelling from the audio guides we were given. Afterwards, ice cream was eaten in vast quantities (apart from Tasmin who dropped her ice cream on Mr Smith’s foot!). We had an enjoyable evening on the beach in the sunshine.
Day two’s breakfast was improved by the addition of some jam, setting us up nicely for the day. This was market day, and our job was to buy our own picnic. Nobody trusted me with the group’s money, but the members of staff were shocked to find that I hadn’t lost it. We all made our best attempts at speaking French, although two groups actually bought Welsh cheddar whilst attempting to buy French cheese! The picnic was enjoyed back at the hotel. We set off to Falaise Castle shortly after. We were lucky to be given the opportunity to trial a new set of iPads giving us an interactive tour of the castle and showing it as it was in the 12th century, which was intriguing. The evening was spent on the beach again, with a sand castle competition.
On the final day we visited the beautiful Bayeux Cathedral and explored the paintings, in particular the story of Thomas Becket. Shortly after, we had an opportunity to show off our independence with the Rallye à Bayeux, which included buying our own lunch in a café. Many embraced the French culture and visited cafés. The final activity of the visit was a trip to Sainte-Mère Église. We visited the Airborne Museum which is all about the American Airborne Division, one of the first groups to liberate areas during the D-Day landings.
We all had a fantastic week, including the staff (I hope!).",What were the activities Year 7 students did during their trip to Normandy?,"The Year 7 students visited the 360⁰ cinema at Arromanches, made and ate biscuits at the Biscuiterie, explored the town, visited the war cemetery in Bayeux, viewed the Bayeux Tapestry, spent time on the beach, bought their own picnic at the market, visited Falaise Castle, visited the Bayeux Cathedral, participated in the Rallye à Bayeux, and visited the Airborne Museum in Sainte-Mère Église."

09/12/2009 at 12:09 6 comments
Football hooligans from for instance Europe will not be able to come to South Africa during the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Home Affairs Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma affirmed during a press conference on Tuesday.
She said an advance passenger processing system was put in place to bar such people from entering South Africa. South Africa in this respect is working closely together with the authorities of countries that have a history of hooliganism, such as the UK, The Netherlands, and Germany.
“The advanced passenger processing [APP] system allows us to bar undesirable elements from entering South Africa before boarding from various countries,” she said.
In addition, the department of Home Affairs will work together with Interpol, international travel agencies and FIFA to monitor for the possible entry of soccer hooligans. It is said that 79 percent of all airlines flying to South Africa during 2010 have pledged their cooperation.

1801,"POMPANO BEACH — Hundreds of Broward Sheriff's deputies and their law enforcement brethren took a brief respite Tuesday from the intense manhunt for a cop killer to pay their respects to Sgt. Chris Reyka and his family.
Funeral visitation was held in the afternoon at the Forest Lawn North Funeral Home and continued through the evening.
Others came from throughout South Florida to honor a man they never met but whose death brought them to tears and renewed their respect for the sacrifices made daily by law enforcement officers.
Sharon Winters, of Deerfield Beach, was among that group. ""These kind of people give everything without asking for much or anything in return,"" she said of the police. ""That's hard to remember when you're getting pulled over for a ticket, or if you live like the animals who killed this fine man.""
Reyka, 51, of Wellington, was shot to death early Friday in the parking lot of a Pompano Beach Walgreen's, where he was checking license plates to see if the tags or the parked cars were stolen. There is a $106,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Reyka's killer.
The shooting was the second in less than a week that left a Broward County deputy dead or wounded. Deputy Maury Hernandez, 28, was shot in the head in Pembroke Park on Aug. 6 and remained in critical condition Tuesday.
The support from people like Winters and members of law enforcement who visited the funeral home, including Broward Sheriff Ken Jenne, left Reyka's distraught family feeling overwhelmingly proud and secure.
""This shows how appreciative everyone is,"" Ashley Reyka, 21, said smiling, referring to her father's involvement in the community, not just his 18 years as a lawman but also as a Boy Scout master and active church member.

We have more than 40 years of combined experience advising home owners and employees. We provide our clients with the personalized representation they need to assert their rights and protect their interests.
A job-related accident or illness can leave you disabled and unable to financially support your family and yourself. Massachusetts, however, provides a way for injured workers to receive certain benefits if they are hurt in the course of their employment. Under the state Workers’ Compensation Act, all employers in the state must carry this no-fault insurance coverage. It provides medical, wage, job retraining, and other benefits to employees who were harmed or became sick as a result of their work.
To qualify for workers’ compensation benefits, your injury or illness must be job-related and cause you to miss at least five days of work. Your employer’s insurer will review your claim to determine your eligibility. If you qualify, you will receive compensation for reasonable and necessary medical costs associated with your injuries, partial wage compensation, and possibly other benefits.
The amount of financial assistance you receive, and the duration, will depend on how much your accident or illness disabled you. The main categories are:
Your employer’s insurer may try to deny your claim for a number of reasons. For instance, it may dispute your eligibility, the extent of your injury or illness, or your need for certain medical care. It may also approve your claim and then later ask the Department of Industrial Accidents (DIA) to reduce your benefits. If the insurer denies or wants to modify your benefits, you can dispute the decision by appealing to the DIA. The dispute process involves various stages, including a meeting with a DIA conciliator and hearings before an administrative judge. You will need to present medical evidence to support your position. Our attorneys have handled numerous workers’ compensation claims. We can advise and represent you if your claim has been denied or if the insurer wants to modify your benefits.
At Pulgini & Norton, we advise home owners, buyers, sellers, and lenders in a broad range of real estate matters. We carefully review and negotiate pivotal documents in the purchase and sale process. Whether you are a buyer or seller, we will negotiate terms that protect your interests while helping you resolve any issues that arise along the way. We can oversee the closing to ensure that documents are properly drafted, signed, and recorded, and that funds are distributed in a timely manner.
We also provide counseling in financing matters. If you need to finance or refinance a mortgage, we can discuss how some provisions, such as a changing interest rate, balloon payment, or other term, can affect your ownership and ability to sell the property in the future. We can also conduct a title search to see if there are any clouds on the title that could affect a lender’s lien on a property. can advise you on your right to benefits and help you appeal any denial of a claim.

Art is a bridge between conscious and unconscious, material and ephemeral. Furthermore, true creativity cannot be born out of ideal logical equation. My current work is very much process- and material- related. Taking into consideration distinctive qualities and mechanical traits of the carbon fiber, an embodiment of the element of carbon in its manmade form, I’m interested in creating visual experiences through deconstruction of its pre-given characteristics such as weave and evenness. Deforming the patterning and recombining material with painted gestures evolves into new modes.
Sweet Samson demonstrated strong interest for drawing and painting since earliest childhood. Started professional career in 2006, as designer of leather goods and accessories, as well as, unique leather chairs. Since 2008 chiefly concentrated on contemporary art and application of wide range of techniques, with interest in researches on creativity and arts in general. She is holder of MFA degree from OTIS College of Art and Design and an inventor of proprietary Dynamic Carbon (fiber and composite materials) application technology, which reflects both artist’s earlier affinities to design and technology, as well as, DNA of lasting fine art dedication and aesthetic.

2289,"Scoop. Colombia’s economy ""está en fuego."" It’s growing at 6.4 percent compared to the same period last year. Impressive? So much so that it makes it the world’s second fastest growing economy behind China.
Two important pieces of comparative data here: one, the U.S. growth for the same period was a negative 2.9 percent. And two, just a decade ago we knew only two things about Colombia: drug wars and Juan Valdez.
Yes, it’s come a long way baby. And now it’s time for us to do the same. The time has come to recognize Colombia, not paternalistically, but as a real cohort — you know, the way we treat Asian and European trading partners. (Smile).
Can we do that, though? Can we get over perceiving countries south of the border at best as weak, inconsistent and malleable? Or, at worst, as ‘banana republics’?
From the Port of Miami alone, 500,000 tourists now arrive annually to places like Cartagena and Santa Marta. And yes, even Medellin –once known for murder and kidnappings – is now known for education and industry.

Since leaving CNN, I have dedicated myself to writing here on Fox News Latino, while interviewing and hosting in Spanish and English, both on radio and on television, focusing mainly on Hispanic issues. And I can say that, with the possible exception of immigration reform, there is no subject that collectively bothers Latinos more passionately than the U.S.’s perceived lack of respect for the countries from which they hail.
It is a truly unifying theme. Regardless of origin, time in the U.S., income status, (insert your own demographic profile here), it doesn’t matter. America’s poor perception of Latin America is the ideological place where an undocumented landscaper from Honduras and a rich Ecuadorian investment banker find common ground almost without fail.
That said, let’s talk about Colombia. Recognizing that talk is cheap, let’s do the numbers. Considering that for 20 years, Colombia has been a haven for organized crime and a bust for investors, it’s amazing to see the transformation. Oil, gas and coal exploration are booming, while foreign investment is near 20 billion. Unemployment, meanwhile, is now down to 8 percent from 12 percent in just the past three years.
And while last week I pointed out in this column the economic disadvantages associated with the free trade deals with respect to Latin America’s rural farmers, the U.S./Colombia Free Trade Agreement has benefited Colombia allowing it to import taxpayer subsidized wheat and barley almost exclusively from the U.S.
Colombia also now exports 350 new products from some 2,000 companies that had previously not shipped goods to the U.S.
And with the drug wars all but over, tourism is once again on the rise. From the Port of Miami alone, 500,000 tourists now arrive annually to places like Cartagena and Santa Marta. And yes, even Medellin –once known for murder and kidnappings – is now known for education and industry.
Colombia is a truly remarkable comeback story, one that is not often told, and one that conflicts with our often tired and misguided perception about Latin America.
By the way, economically speaking, Colombia is not alone. In fact, it’s number three. That’s right; Colombia is Latin America’s third largest economy behind Mexico and Brazil —-something for all of us to consider the next time we think about Latin America.

1970,"In this lick, I’m using the E pentatonic blues scale and the diminished 7th scale or arpeggio.
The notes in the E minor blues scale (or E flat 5 pentatonic) are:
E, G, A, Bb, B, D, (E)
The notes in the diminished 7th arpeggio (or diminished scale) are:
E, G, Bb, C#, (E)
You can see that the only differences here are the omission of the A and the B and the added note C#, which is the major 6th.
These scales cross over very well as the major 6th note, which appears in the diminished 7th scale, is also very commonly used in the pentatonic scale, so tonally there are no surprises here. What is essential though, is the order of the notes.
It's always very important to remember that even though there are huge similarities with these scales, we must understand them individually. This is what creates the tonal difference and gives shape and color to your playing.
What I'm doing in the first part of this lick is accenting the flat 5 rather than using it as a passing note. This creates a very intense sound. It’s a great thing to have in your arsenal if you want to have the ability to get a little darker with the pentatonic scale.
Adding these scales together and creating one super scale is something that should be experimented with, but you should never lose sight of the individual scale. If you wanted to add them together you can view the scale as the E minor pentatonic flat 5 added major 6th.
The lick
I start this lick with an E minor flat 5 arpeggio. One of my favorite shapes, the E minor flat 5 arpeggio flows very nicely under the fingers.
Once I play the arpeggio through I slide up to the 17th fret and play a three-string arpeggio, then move back into the original position and play the five-string arpeggio back to the starting position. This whole process repeats twice.
On the third time through I play the arpeggio once more but then slide to the 12th fret and play a different inversion of the same arpeggio, this time on all six strings.
From there we move into the diminished section. This is where I bring into play my right hand to tap notes. This section is a little tricky, but remember that the diminished 7th scale is linear, so the shapes are always the same. You simply have to move the scale up in minor thirds.
This is one of the beautiful things about incorporating the diminished 7th scale into your playing. Once you nail the shapes in one position you basically have the whole fretboard covered as the patterns always repeat in minor thirds!

1214,"Bruxism is the medical term for teeth grinding or teeth clenching. Occasional bruxism is nothing to be alarmed about, but the condition becomes problematic with the teeth grinding occurs regularly. Grinding or clenching of the teeth often occurs during sleep. In most cases, it is caused by missing or crooked teeth or an abnormal bite. Anxiety and stress may also be directly or indirectly associated with teeth grinding.
Chronic teeth grinding has many negative implications to your teeth. With your teeth being constantly subjected to the force of your bite, grinding may wear the teeth down and cause it to become prone to fracturing. It also loosens teeth, which eventually leads to tooth loss. Myofascial muscle pain is also a common result of teeth grinding, as well as persistent headaches and TMJ dysfunction. Grinding your teeth also abrades and weakens the enamel often causing the dentin to be exposed, making the teeth more susceptible to dental decay and fracture. Some people also experience gum recession, along with other complications associated with chronic bruxism like arthritis of the temporomandibular joints.
Teeth grinding often occurs during sleep, which is why most people remain unaware of the habit until it is pointed out to them by a loved one or until they experience telltale signs like sore jaw, and dull, but constant headaches. Having your teeth, mouth, and jaw examined by a dentist can help you determine whether teeth grinding has any impact on your teeth and/or TMJ.
Teeth grinding can be corrected by wearing a mouth guard during sleep. Dental guards or splints significantly reduce tooth abrasion and reduce muscle strain by constraining the teeth grinding pattern, which also helps reduce damage to the TMJ. Other ways to prevent or stop teeth grinding include relieving stress, taking muscle relaxants, and cutting back on stimulants like caffeine, chocolates, and colas. Since bruxism is more of a habit than a dysfunction, restraining yourself from chewing things apart from food (pencil, gum, etc.) also helps reduce the condition.",What are some of the negative implications of chronic teeth grinding?,"Chronic teeth grinding can wear the teeth down, cause them to become prone to fracturing, loosen teeth leading to tooth loss, cause myofascial muscle pain, persistent headaches, TMJ dysfunction, abrade and weaken the enamel exposing the dentin, make the teeth more susceptible to dental decay and fracture, cause gum recession, and other complications like arthritis of the temporomandibular joints."
1446,"I’ve been busy working on my English Rose dress today and I am happy with the way the zip has turned out. Instead of tacking the back opening together and pushing the teeth of the zip through the gap (as it said to do on the instructions) I followed my tutors advice and tacked each side of the zip to the back opening making sure the teeth lined up with the edge of the fabric. The result is the teeth of the zip are perfectly covered by the fabric. The stitching is nice and straight because I could move the zipper up/down whilst sewing so that the stitches did not have to curve around the zipper (which they would have done if I followed the instructions as the zipper would have been stuck in one place).
To complete the back section of the dress I tacked and sewn 2 godets into place. I’m really happy with how professional these ones look after having built up my confidence on the front godets. So now it was time for the straightforward task of sewing the front and back pieces together and ta-dah...no longer lots of odd pieces, but 1 garment! A further 2 godets were sewn into place on the side seams to complete the fullness of the skirt (which is very, very full)!
After trying the dress on, it is a little big on the top half so it’s going to need taking in a little. I’m not an expert on this so I’m going to wait until my class next Thursday for my tutor’s help.

NAIROBI, March 27 (Xinhua) -- advance wildlife conservation agenda in Africa amid rising tide of isolationism from the West.
""Both China and Africa should discuss how to strengthen protection of wildlife and wild lands against a backdrop of infrastructure development and industrialization in the continent,"" said Sebunya.
Sino-Africa collaboration in wildlife protection was elevated a notch higher during the December 2015 Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) where China announced new support to advance ecological conservation in the continent.
Sebunya hailed China for making practical steps to help African countries protect their wildlife from threats linked to poaching and habitat loss.
He singled out the decision by China on December 31, 2016 to ban ivory processing and trade until the need of 2017, terming it a milestone in protection of Africa's elephants.
""China's decision to ban ivory trade by the end of 2017 is a game changer in curbing elephant poaching and illegal trade in wildlife,"" remarked Sebunya.
Sebunya emphasized that a healthy balance between economic development and ecological protection should underpin China's engagement with Africa.
""There is need for a pragmatic approach that ensures economic development is not detrimental to our wildlife heritage and other ecosystems,"" said Sebunya.
He noted that China's pioneering ecological protection initiatives against a backdrop of rapid industrialization can be emulated by African countries as they chart new development pathways.
""There are big lessons to learn on how China has managed to protect its pandas,"" Sebunya remarked, adding that African countries can borrow vital lessons from China's mistakes and successes in its quest for economic development.
He added that Africa's conservation lobbies are committed to a robust partnership with Chinese institutions to revitalize wildlife conservation in the continent.",What significant step did China take in December 2016 to help protect Africa's wildlife?,"China made the decision on December 31, 2016 to ban ivory processing and trade until the end of 2017, which was a significant step in protecting Africa's elephants."

Information - Interior equipment
The interior of the car offers car owners a lot of ways to personalize their car. On the other hand, a lot of car owners prefer to keep the original interior of the car salon. It is especially important for owners of antique vehicles and luxury cars, since their cost will reduce because of these transformations. For ordinary cars it is not a big problem.
LED interior lighting is very common when speaking about tuning. Various creative solutions are possible even for coverings. Standard gear lever knob and cups are usually replaced with sports version. The same is about the steering wheel. Often it is replaced with a small and handy one. Sport pedals, which are available in different variants, are also very popular. In any case, you should always use licensed spare parts. The reason is that in the event of an accident there can be problems with insurance. Be careful when using used parts.
Salon equipment also includes belts, door handles, chrome inserts and many other parts. For each of the original parts there is produced a corresponding spare part. Often it is possible to built-in a part that looks differently. Thus, the interior of the car can be changed both slightly or completely. Each car owner decides how far he can go when modifying the car salon. The majority of production cars look great with the original factory interior.

The group equally expressed deep concern over the state of affairs in the state, under the Fayose administration, saying therewas an urgent need for the party to stand up and rescue Ekiti, in the midst of the crisis trailing the various arms of government.
Rising from its meeting of May 1, 2015 in Ado Ekiti, the ERG specifically praised Nigerians for making it difficult for the PDP to rig the outcome of the presidential race, which produced Major Gen.MuhammaduBuhari, the candidate of the APC, whom it expressed confidence in, as someone capable of turning around the country’s fortune
A statement signed by the body and made available to journalists, in Ado Ekiti, on Tuesday, disclosed that it recognised the need to urgently mobiliseresources towards strengthening the party andmotivate all party stakeholders within the party with a view to reactivating its formidable election winning machinery in the state.

2184,". My hopes and dreams of being married by my mid-twenties were gone.
When I turned thirty, I was still single and finally ready to yield control to the Lord and allow Him to guide me — including my dating habits. Looking back, I can see some big dating mistakes I made in my twenties that I was able to correct in my thirties. Here are three of them:
Fun vs. Substance
In my twenties, I found myself interested in the attractive, athletic, and adventurous type. Although these characteristics are certainly not wrong to desire, I pursued them more than I pursued what God values in a life partner. I was drawn to a woman who could spike a volleyball more than a woman who loved Jesus.
In my thirties, I realized that her character was far more important than her knowledge of my favorite NFL team. Proverbs 31:30 talks of how a woman who fears the Lord — who puts Jesus first in her life — is the one to be desired. I finally realized that being purposeful in a dating relationship is not only a great way to avoid unnecessary heartache, but also to find someone who is serious about the right things.
Physicality vs. Purity
Through mistakes I had made in my twenties, I learned that any physicality had the tendency to distract me from seeking to genuinely get to know the other person. I learned that even going down the path of holding hands and kissing leads to heightened emotions, creating a false sense of familiarity.
According to Scripture, physical affection that is sexual in nature is to be reserved for marriage (Hebrews 13:4, Ephesians 5:3). And once that door is opened, it can be very difficult to put on the brakes.
When I started to date my wife Laura, we purposely set physical boundaries right from the beginning of the relationship. This was unique to both of us, and unlike our past relationships, we found that we were able to put Christ first as we got to know each other at a healthy pace. We also discovered that a pure relationship led to peace and joy, compared to the nagging sense of guilt and shame we experienced in other relationships when sexual sin was present.
Isolation vs. Community
I remember years ago being in a brand-new relationship. We started dating after having only talked a couple of times. We spent every day and evening that we possibly could with each other. Let’s just say that “dude time” for me diminished. My buddies, whom I loved hanging out with, probably thought I had dropped off the face of the earth. As I spent time with my new girlfriend, I found myself less and less connected to community and accountability. I may not have admitted it, but I knew what I was doing. The more I distanced myself from biblical community, the more I knew that people would have a hard time speaking into my life. And as long as that happened, I fooled myself into thinking I could ignore the Holy Spirit’s conviction.
After spending several years thinking I could manage just fine on my own, it all caught up with me. Reaping what I had sown became a reality in my life. Just before I turned 30, I went through a broken engagement only months away from the wedding, and in the process, I found that I was broken. I was hurting. I needed help. Through the loving pursuit of some close friends at my church, I realized the safest place to be was surrounded by godly people who could encourage me in the truth of God’s Word. They cared enough to speak into my life and hold me accountable. With their support, I found the strength to make better dating decisions.
Turning around to move forward
When I was entering my thirties, still single and having just gone through some challenging lessons, I knew I needed to make some decisions. Was I going to continue down the path I was on, or choose a different path, one of faith and obedience to the Lord?
Thankfully, through the encouragement of close friends and the empowerment of the Holy Spirit, I was able to give up what I had been holding onto for so long. The desire to be married was an idol that dictated the decisions I was making. Have you been in this place before? Are you there now? C.S. Lewis says:
…”
So often “doing an about-turn” is painful. But we have a compassionate God who is ready to forgive (1 John 1:9). Progress is not having a spouse we adore, but having a Savior we confide in. For me, progress was when I finally decided to put God first in my life, yielding the desires I had so desperately to be married. And when I did eventually have the opportunity to date again, being intentional, striving for purity, and surrounding myself with community were all fruit of the progress I was making.

Edited by Julie Wilson
Routledge – 2010 – 330 pages
Routledge – 2010 – 330 pages-of-the-art review of the field, documenting advances in research and evaluating different perspectives, approaches, techniques and contexts.
The Routledge Handbook of Tourism Geographies considers recent disciplinary developments (including post-disciplinarily) in geography in relation to the study of tourism. It also analyzes the fledging relationships of the new mobilities paradigm, critical tourism studies and cultural political economy to tourism spaces and places, as well as acknowledging a spatial turn in poststructuralist social sciences more generally. In addition, it evaluates how postcolonial, feminist, sensory, performative and queer perspectives have diversified research in the tourism geographies field. Spatial analysis, time geography, placemaking and landscape concerns are addressed and issues such as transport, environmental discourses and development are also analyzed. Finally, the volume’s contributions highlight key areas for advancing research and map out the dimensions of future trajectories in tourism geographies in different theoretical and thematic contexts.
Written by leading scholars in the tourism geographies field, this text will provide an invaluable resource for all those with an interest in tourism geographies, encouraging dialogue across disciplinary boundaries and areas of study.

Currently, you can use Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin to pay for cinema tickets on the AMC website. According to one tweet from AMC CEO Adam Aron, the company also plans to accept Dogecoin next time.
Great news feature! As promised, many new ways to pay online at AMC NOW. We now accept with pride:
Although not confirmed, Aron specifically encourages online purchases with crypto, so it does not appear that you will be able to go into your local cinema and pay for a movie with crypto. Instead, you need to buy tickets in advance if you want to use your Bitcoin and other currencies. Even though it makes it a little less exciting, it’s still a great way to spend your money if you do not want to sit on them.
Aaron’s tweet also mentions that the new online payment methods “already account for 14 percent of our total online transactions.” However, he also mentioned accepting Apple Pay, Google Pay and PayPal, so it looks like they are included in that number. It makes it unclear how popular it actually is to pay for movies with crypto, but we expect the number of people using it to be quite low.

1646,"Talbots closing San Diego store
Classy women's retailer has struggled with losses in recent years
The classy women's clothing brand Talbots Inc. will close its Fashion Valley store around June 10 as part of a nationwide consolidation, leaving only three stores in the county.
A sign outside the Fashion Valley store says that items are at 50 percent to 70 percent off. The fixtures are also for sale. The Westfield UTC and La Jolla stores remain open. There is also a Talbots in The Forum at Carlsbad.
""As part of our previously announced plans to reduce Talbots store base and square footage, we will be closing our Fashion Valley store,"" said company spokeswoman Julie Lorigan. ""We appreciate the San Diego community for its support over the years and we are pleased that our customers will be able to continue to shop with Talbots at our La Jolla and UTC locations or at Talbots.com.""
The Hingham, Mass., company is known for its well-made clothing with traditional, breezy, modest designs suitable for a day on Cape Cod or a ladies' lunch. It sells a lot of trench coats, ballet flats, floral dresses and crisp white shirts. The company has struggled recently, with annual losses in three of the past four years. It had to offer steep discounts to move merchandise during the holidays.
This week, the company said it has received a sweetened buyout offer from its largest shareholder, the private equity firm Sycamore Partners, that values the company at about $211 million.
By its most recent count, Talbots operated 517 stores. In December, the company outlined plans for cutting corporate jobs, trimming store employees' hours, and closing a total of 110 stores by the end of 2013. While Talbots is closing underperforming stores, it plans to remodel ""premium stores"" and expand its premium outlet division.
To save money, the company also suspended its national advertising and TV campaigns, reduced store employees' hours and discontinued a children's line.
Founded in 1947, the retailer's customers are mainly women 35 years old and up.

1351,"Utilize these travel tips before traveling
Everyone, including the small kids, would love to travel. The mere idea of going out for a picnic or outing and having fun brings excitement into everyone’s mind. People dream of around the world; however, not everyone can afford the world tour’s finances. Some people with the excellent financial condition make their dream come true, but for those who do not have unlimited finances, ‘budget travel’ is the best option. As money is the significant deciding factor while planning the vacations, chalking out your budget and planning according to your finances is the wisest thing to do.
Grab The Best Deals:
Many websites offer various discount coupons on booking air tickets, hotel rooms, etc. Find such websites and get some relief for your pocket. Many hotels give considerable discounts on group bookings. Visit Delta Airlines Reservations to get amazing best deals on vacation packages around the world.
Compare various travel agencies’ prices and offer before booking your vacation. This way, you can stick to the idea of budget travel and save money. Give a thought to the travel insurance so that, unfortunately, if you lose your luggage or any valuables while on vacation, the insurance money can cover up at least some of your loss.
Plan In Advance:
Book your tickets and make hotel reservation two to three months in advance. This way, you can save up some money as most airlines and hotels give enormous discounts for bookings. You can begin saving some components of your monthly income for your holiday. You’re likely in the future to don’t feel the pinch all of a sudden.
Keep Your Eyes Wide Opened:
Keep one thing in mind while shopping once you reach your holiday destination. Many items are available at much cheaper rates in the shops near your home. So do your shopping, keeping your eyes open, and do not shop just for the sake of it. When you are in the market and like something, think twice before buying it, see whether it is necessary and useful, or it will stay at the bottom of the cupboard the moment you reach back home. Please do not buy the things that are too heavy or space-consuming as it will be troublesome for you to carry it back home. Instead, you will unnecessarily spend extra, and your budget might collapse. Stick to your account to avoid financial burden after your vacation.
Traveling on a Budget
Some people think that to travel and see the world; you have to stay in a 5-star hotel every night, eat at the fanciest restaurants, see every attraction that the city offers, and buy a suitcase full of souvenirs to take home. Real travelers know that this is not the case. Sure, traveling can be expensive, but there are quite a few painless ways to make a wonderful, memorable vacation within your reach.
When to go
Travel seasons have a vast range in prices, depending on when you go. If you want to go during peak season, you are going to pay for it. Just remember that “off-season” doesn’t mean that it is a wrong time to go; it usually just means that you will get more value for your money with fewer people thrown in. It may still be a fantastic trip, possibly even better than ordinary, considering you don’t need to worry so much about cash or audiences.
How to get there
It used to be that driving was always the cheapest way to get places, but with rising fuel costs, that isn’t still the case anymore. Be sure to do your research to calculate gas costs before assuming driving would be the most economical. Should you wind up flying, make sure you look around, such as budget airlines, to receive the ideal cost. Consider flying on non-peak days or at non-peak times to get the best price. (Yes, this includes taking the dreaded red-eye!)
Where to stay
When you get to your destination, staying at the Four Seasons isn’t the only option. Think about places where you can stay with friends or family for a few days; that way, you can visit and get a free place to stay. (Always remember to be a good house guest though to ensure you remain friends!) Another option is doing a home exchange where a family would stay in your house while you are in their place. It’s an excellent way to observe the region you’re visiting through a neighborhood’s eye, not pay for resorts in any way.
How to get around
Grabbing a cab each time that you wish to go anyplace can consume your money pretty quickly. If you’re in a city using public transit, look at carrying that as your principal point of transport. Conquering the public transit system in another place gives you a feeling of triumph like no other. If you’ve to lease a car for a holiday, shop around to find the best price and see whether there are some coupons on the market or revenue running in the time before you reserve it.
What to do
Once you are at your destination, don’t think that you have to see every attraction there. Pick and choose based on your family’s wants and needs and remember there are heaps of free or cheap Items in many cities such as museums, churches, and national parks, which may be a wonderful idea to spend the afternoon.",What are some tips for budget travel according to the context?,"Some tips for budget travel include grabbing the best deals by comparing various travel agencies' prices and offers, planning in advance by booking tickets and making hotel reservations two to three months ahead, shopping wisely at the holiday destination, and considering travel insurance. It also suggests traveling during off-peak seasons, considering budget airlines, staying with friends or family or doing a home exchange, using public transit as the primary mode of transport, and choosing free or cheap attractions to visit."

As you know, I'm the Maid of Honor for my darling sister's wedding. Or, as she calls me.. Maid of Horror. (I'm just not cut out for this, y'all..) The hardest part has to be not being in Trinidad with her and trying to plan everything. I'm a visual person and like to see what I'm working with, so discussing ordering invitations and not being able to see what she's doing or looking at was difficult.
Luckily, when we were ordering invitations for her engagement party, we were using Wedding Paper Divas. If you haven't read my post about ordering samples for invitations, I suggest you do it now. WPD made it so ridiculously easy for me to follow along on whatever idea she was going with, because we managed to each order our own set of samples - so we saw the same samples in person and could mutually decide on what we liked, instead of me going crazy trying to visualize the paper and material and text and feel and quality.
We ordered the most beautiful engagement invitations (we ordered these), had a perfect engagement party where I got to see the love of her life put a perfect ring on her finger (I'm Lebanese, and our tradition is to wait until the engagement party and the ring is blessed before you can put the ring on your finger) and danced all night. It was practically a wedding. Except it wasn't.
The day after the engagement, Steph and I decided we didn't want to wait, and wanted to order thank you cards right away. And where better to look than Wedding Paper Divas? That's where the wedding suite comes in.
Wedding Paper Divas literally has everything you need for your wedding, engagement party, or anything. Whether it's save the dates, invitations, bridal shower invites, thank you cards or all of the above in one big package, they have you covered. And the quality is like none other. I'm telling you it impressed my mother, and she's the pickiest person I know..

Seriously sounds like such a great company to work with! When you have such excellent customer service I'm sure that takes so much stress off the wedding!

I'll definitely have to keep Wedding Paper Divas in mind for when I get married. I'm really nervous about choosing my bridesmaids because most of the ones I want to choose live so far, which will probably make planning things a little difficult for them like it has been for you, but I'm sure everything will turn out okay in the end (duh it will). The invites pictured above are so cute and elegant! I love them.
I loooooove wedding planning and I'm so jealous you're doing it as the MOH!
Beautiful design. I wish I would have known about them when I got married!
Sounds like a great company, oh if only I knew about it last summer when both of my little sisters got married! I'll definitely have to keep them in mind for any friends weddings!! The invites look so perfect!
Those are gorgeous!
I'll keep this company in mind for future reference.

429,"GRAND RAPIDS – Gov. Rick Snyder appears ready to tap Varnum LLP, one of West Michigan's largest law firms, as a partner for another next leg of his economic development agenda.
A media advisory sent this afternoon says Snyder plans to announce the MiSpringboard program, “a new service that will be offered for Michigan start-up businesses,” Wednesday at 11:30 a.m..
While not specified on the advisory, MiSpringboard is the same name used by Grand Rapids-based Varnum for a Twitter account focused on supporting Michigan start-up firms.
“Michigan. Entrepreneurs. Jobs. Free. Help. Growth. To be announced June 2011,” a description line tied to the Twitter account reads.
The web address mispringboard.com leads to a currently inactive page on Varnum's corporate website.
Pure Michigan Business Connect is Snyder's $3 billion economic development initiative announced last week that includes state incentives for start ups and business expansion, a collateral matching program, a $2 billion commitment to lend to Michigan businesses by Huntington Bank and a website that helps serve as a clearinghouse for businesses in need of help as they grow.

51,"On Saturday, November 14, it appears that president-elect Joe Biden and first lady-in-waiting Dr. Jill Biden spent their day like many of us did—on a bike ride.
The pair—along with four members of their secret service detail, riding Cannondale hardtails—cruised around the paved trails of Cape Henlopen State Park in Delaware, before a meeting with Biden’s transition team. Members of the media and photographers took videos and photos of the group—in this video, you can hear Yahoo News reporter Brittany Shepherd asking, “Are you any closer to making a cabinet decision?” to which Biden responds, “Yes.”
Sign up for Bicycling All Access, and we’ll let you know every time Biden is spotted on a bike
Biden appeared to be riding a Trek FX hybrid, and a well-loved one from the looks of it. From what we could see in the photos, it had a Bontrager cockpit, linear pull rim brakes, and a rusty chain well past its prime. He came prepared for the ride with a headlight, and all of the bike’s reflectors are still intact (he’s the president-elect, he can do what he wants)..
We can’t tell exactly what bike Jill is riding, but it looks to be similar to Biden’s—something functional and affordable. Affixed to her handlebar is an Axiom Seymour Handlebar Bag created with fabric made out of recycled fishing nets, as well as a small headlight. While Biden’s bike has a rigid fork, Jill’s is equipped with an RST suspension fork, leading us to believe she likes to get a little more sendy than the president-elect.
Jill is wearing a Liv Rev Comp MIPS helmet and a jacket with the logo of Pelotonia, a charity ride in Ohio that raises money for cancer research, at which Biden gave a send-off speech in 2017. And everyone riding in this group is wearing a mask, which is important, given the rising cases of COVID-19 around the country.
The last time the media was shouting to Biden on a bike was in August, when he was riding the same Trek in Delaware. Fox News’ Peter Doocy asked the then-candidate if he’d chosen a running partner yet. Biden said he had, and when Doocy asked who, he jokingly responded “You!” (spoiler alert: it was not him).
We’re stoked that our president-to-be and future first lady are into cycling, and will be on high alert for any more #RidinWithBiden in the news.",What type of bike was president-elect Joe Biden riding on his trip to Cape Henlopen State Park?,President-elect Joe Biden was riding a Trek FX hybrid bike.

1335,"Water damage in your home is frustrating and destructive. You and your family are could be forced to leave and your belongings damaged or destroyed. Preventing or reducing the risk of water damage in your home is part of being a responsible homeowner. As water damage restoration professionals, we see the results of water damage everyday from appliance failures, mechanical mishaps, and sometimes even human error. While there are some things out of your control, there are things you can do to prevent water damage from happening. We’ve put together some tips for you.
Learn How to Turn off the Water
Every adult in the household should know how to turn off the main water valve in your home. Should water damage happen in your home, this is your first step towards minimizing the damage and stopping the flow of water.
Be Vigilant with Plumbing and Mechanical System Maintenance
Burst water heaters and broken pipes cause quick, amounts of water that can flood your home in a matter of minutes.
Arrange to have a bi-annual plumbing and HVAC maintenance service plan with your plumbing and hvac contractor. During this appointment, the heating and cooling systems of your home will be inspected and serviced.
Keep your Appliances Well Maintained
Water damage from leaking dishwasher, refrigerator lines, and washing machines can be either slow or sudden and dramatic. The amount of water generated from these appliances can flood your entire home rapidly and water travels downward affecting the floors beneath them. During everyday use, make it a habit to look around and check connections, water lines, and pipes. Be aware of unusual noises and follow up on leaks asap. See something? Call your plumbing contractor right away.
Away on Vacation
Picture water flowing from a broken pipe, failed appliance, or overflowed toilet. Now imagine that water continuing to flood your home for many days like at the end of the classic movie Home Alone. Make it a habit to turn off the main water supply before leaving for vacation. You’ll be glad you did!
If your time away is during cold weather, be sure to leave the heat on low so you don’t have frozen pipes. Arrange for someone to check on your home regularly while you are away to make sure things are okay.
Is Your Sump Pump Working?

515,"You'd think the voice behind the galaxy's worst dad would be a little biased when it comes to playing favorites in 'Star Wars.' When Moviefone caught up with James Earl Jones to hear his thoughts on the upcoming 'Star Wars: The Complete Saga' Blu-ray release, however, the acclaimed actor revealed that Darth Vader wasn't Darth Vader's favorite character.
""Chewbacca is my favorite,"" Jones said by phone to great nods of approval in Moviefone HQ. Read on to find out why Jones thinks Darth Vader has remained such a powerful presence during the last four decades, how his Governors Award acceptance speech is coming along, and what it's like having 'Dr. Strangelove' as his first starring role.
Why do you think the voice of Darth Vader has remained so powerful over the course of 30 years?
Well, a hidden voice, a hidden face creates a lot of mystery. It leaves everything up to the audience's imagination.
I had an unusual experience not too long ago. There was a lady from Finland, a doctor, who had a theater in Washington, D.C. where she put masks on young, impaired children. And there was a narrator, so all the kids had to do was come out and face each other, make certain gestures, and these faces were the only things you would look at. You weren't bothered by their impairment, so it freed your imagination as to who's talking behind that mask. The same thing happens with Darth Vader.
Besides it being scary, perhaps, you're also freed from having to be impressed by what he looks like. Your imagination can go wild.
So is Darth Vader your favorite 'Star Wars' character?
Chewbacca is my favorite.
What a great choice! My co-workers are all nodding their heads in approval.
[Laughs] Oh, really?
So are you excited or nervous for your Governors Award at this year's Oscars?
My wife and I have not stopped cheering with joy yet, so we haven't really had the chance to be nervous. And I also say that the award goes to the whole village because they've done as much for it as I have.
I think you're selling yourself a bit short there.
Well I'm very proud of it.
How's the acceptance speech coming along?
Oh, I hope to say very little. [laughs]
Alright, one more question. What's it like having 'Dr. Strangelove' as your big-screen debut?
Well I think what made it a cult hit was the universities, young people on college campuses, because the military didn't like that movie. It was too much of a put-down and the population was very pro-military then, so nobody said, ""Oh, that's my favorite movie."" But the young kids did and this was before counter-culture, too.
When your humor has to come out of a dignified officer shooting a Coke machine, I was like, ""Come on, are we back in 'Animal House?'"" I didn't know whether I wanted to take that seriously or not, but that's a kind of humor that [screenwriter] Terry Southern was into back then. I worked with him on something else later, but I wasn't really sure if I recommended that as a level of sense of humor.
But it wasn't a sense of humor, I guess, it was something else -- a sense of irony, a sense of cynicism, and all that we needed to replace the worship of war. And we still need it, I guess.
So who's the better 'Star Wars' character: Vader or Chewie?

1267,"I am temporarily abandoning my artisan bread in 5 wet dough for kneading.
Yesterday I attempted bread using Rhonda's bread making for beginners recipe . A traditional method involving kneading. I followed her recipe quite closely, wanting to give myself the best chance of success before I observed how it works and if we like at which point I can begin my personal 'tweaking' of the recipe. My only variations were that I did not use the gluten Flour and I used sesame seeds on the top only. I didn't take into account our super efficient oven when baking so I came away with a very dark upper crust and a thin line of doughiness in the loaf ... about 2mm so not enough to affect it really.
So today when I try it again I will preheat at a temp a little lower.
I used to be scared of yeast and scared of kneading, they both seemed to be so 'specialised' in my mind. I shied away from anything that involved them as 'out of my range of ability' and 'too many things can go wrong' options.
I got over my fears of these issues making 'Super Easy pizza Dough' a recipe I found on Best Recipes somehow in my mind making my own pizza was something I could do and try ... not as big a deal as bread ...
I laugh to myself about it now as they are essentially the same thing, the process for making Pizza dough is the same as the process for kneaded bread, its just the recipe that is different. As I made Rhonda's bread yesterday I considered subbing the butter for olive oil ... but I think I'll save that option for savoury bread's that I top with cheese and tomatoes ... or that I add herbs to.
We had this bread with dinner last night, still slightly warm. If you are used to artisan bread this loaf is light and soft in comparison, The crust is crisp but not chewy and thick as with the Artisan method breads. I encourage you all to give it a go. Rhonda has posted on her blog today regarding making bread and I see she has modified her base recipe a little from the one in the tutorial I linked to earlier here but I used the older recipe and it worked just fine so use which ever you are comfortable with. If you haven't made bread before I suggest you go to the tutorial, use that recipe and follow the steps.
A couple of you asked about the freshness of bread stored in a fabric bag, with non reply addresses. So my answers are here ...
At the end of last nights meal I put our half loaf into the fabric bag and left it on the bench overnight. This morning I had bread and jam for breakfast. The bread this morning was firmer and easier to cut - probably because it had completely cooled and when I last cut it it was still warm.
The cut surface of the bread was drier but still acceptable to eat with butter and jam. Not noticeable dryness.
For the girl/lady who makes all of her bread at the beginning of the week and store's it I'm not sure that fabric bags would keep bread fresh in that circumstance. Ours would not typically be in a bag for more than 24 hours so I can't give you an informed answer Sorry.
So what are you all waiting for ... step away from the computer and go make some bread ; )
Let us know on the forum or through the blog comments how you go.
Happy Wednesday.
That bread looks really yummy - light and soft. Well done Tammy. I've yet to venture past the pizza dough and I might give this recipe a go. Thanks for the link!
Let me be totally honest here - me don't like kneading - that is why I have a love relationship with my bread maker (grin).
I am so looking forward to having an oven - baking!! Looks yummy.
Looks delicious!
Gosh I haven't made any bread in ages, I will have to give it a go.
Linda
Oh yummy. I LOVE homemade bread. Especially the smell as it's baking. I just wish I could make a good loaf of homemade bread. I'm gonna have to try again someday.
Thanks so much for visiting my blog and taking the time to comment.
I hope you have a great day!! Beth. :)
Look great Tammy. I have just switched from Rhonda's tutorial to the artisan bread in 5. Haha. I love Rhonda's bread though, I just switched because i got the book for Christmas and as I have been a little strapped for time the idea of not having to knead is appealing on a regular basis. I'll still make a loaf or two of Rhonda's during the week though. Looks delicious- it's really good with pumpkin and sunflower seeds too. xo m.",What were the variations the author made to Rhonda's bread recipe?,The author did not use the gluten Flour and used sesame seeds on the top only.

Then she guessed what would happen and I wrote it down for her. She put the gummies in overnight and we waited to see what would happen!
She documented the results in her journal!
The next morning, we woke up and checked on our gummies and reported our findings!

Z, you sounded so defeated reviewing this film like it sucked the soul out of you or something. I completely agree with you guys though but if you had to remake twilight would you follow the books? change the cast and if so who would you cast?
You guys are gonna laugh at this but just got done listening to the daily spill today and heard Cyrus yell, “THE FUTURE.” How do you guys feel that your inspiring people to use your catchphrases hahahaha.
P.S.
Since this show started I notice on Facebook and Twitter people posting Throwback moments on Tuesdays hahaha. Great show as always and fuck Twilight.
Let’s play a game! P1 I want you to say one positive thing about Twilight: Breaking Dawn 1 and Z I want you to say something positive about The Host. No back handed compliments but something you generally mean that is something that is good about both of these films. Game on guys.
Glad to see you guys will be doing a martial arts film. Ip Man is definitely one of the best, what would you consider one of your favorite martial arts film?
Damn, this movie is horrible. I really have no idea why Twilight was such a success. Can either of you guys explain this to me? Anyway, nice show guys. This is the only podcast show that I listen to daily. It doesn’t matter if I have heard the shows before or not. You guys are great and I can’t wait to hear more from you.
Z, I heard you on eopodcast before talking about Resident Evil. Why aren’t you on the show anymore? How could you put up with Sock or whatever his name is? He didnt even give any of the later movies of Resident Evil a chance. I can’t even listen to the shows anymore, because its just a lot of yelling. Thankfully you two don’t do this and you guys seem like you respect each other’s opinions. That is why you guys have a great show. Can’t wait to listen to more from the two of year.
TPO, I’m not going against Lehew. But have you ever thought of having Z as a co-host on Movie Spoilers?

428,"Several wonderful must-experience things are happening at this pair of Airbnbs. First, there are the adorable llamas and alpacas roaming the grounds. Then there are the accommodations themselves: your choice of a colorful stunner of a luxury cottage or a tree house.
And the setting for this already-amazing scene is a bamboo forest — not off on some faraway tropical island, but in the middle of Atlanta, of all places.
What’s more, the alpacas and llamas are rescues, and the tree house was built from reclaimed materials. It sounds like one heck of a retreat!
I mean, come on, can you imagine waking up in the morning and seeing Figgy the llama out your window?
Well, hold on. If you opt for the tree house, you’re not going to catch that view of a friendly critter right out your window, because it sits high above the forest floor on stilts.
The tree house has become a huge success on Airbnb, with people renting it not just for overnight stays but weddings and other events.
But Kara O’Brien, the owner of this little corner of paradise, didn’t get a lot of support for her plan at the outset. “Everyone said it was a terrible idea,” she told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “But I’m not one to really listen to other people.”
The tree house is currently going for $375 per night on Airbnb, and the cottage is $134 a night. O’Brien also offers a “Llama Alpaca Experience” on Airbnb so visitors can meet the animals even if they’re not staying in the cottage or tree house.
Since it’s made from reclaimed materials, the tree house has some interesting details. For example, the main entry door came from a 120-year-old house in Atlanta that once belonged to the mayor:
The cottage is really charming, too.
It’s not among the bamboo, but it’s on the farm, so you’re adjacent to all of the llama and alpaca action:
In a video the Atlanta Journal-Constitution shared about the Airbnb units, O’Brien talks about how the tree house has brought people together in surprising ways.
“We’ve had proposals and weddings — it seems like it’s a place where people have come together, and celebrate each other and are really happy, and that was something we didn’t expect when we started it.”
The llamas and alpacas are in the video, too, so you should definitely watch:
O’Brien notes in the video that the bamboo forest’s origins are a bit of a mystery, but people think it’s been there since the 1940s.
Really, a hint of mystery just adds to the allure of this place.
That and baby llamas.
One of O’Brien’s Instagram captions sums it up. “There’s a llama in my bamboo forest.”
Who wouldn’t want to stay here?
Time to pack your bags for Atlanta, my friends.

Donald. An elegant soul. Music, art, words, humor, friendship – you shared your thoughts and your kindness with equal, enormous generosity. I feel such a deep, deep sorrow. I miss you terribly. Comfort and condolences to all who knew and loved you–Lynn Robb
Brave, beautiful, funny, smart, open. I met Donald at Cal Arts in 1976, he was talking about art and science, Tesla(who?) and doing just weird wonderful stuff. He babysat my daughter Maura, everyone bonded with Donald. He made a difference–Marc Pally
So sorry to see you have to go ♥— Tina Sills
Donald, you’ve always been in my heart, continually, since I met you in high school. I can’t believe you are gone.— Dan Gunning
I’m shocked and dismayed. I have an email from Donald saying he’s under the weather (April 23rd) he’ll write soon about ideas for our next Corita extravaganza. I had barely scratched the surface in getting to know Donald’s huge array of gifts and talents, surprising stories and experiences — I am so grateful to have known him and to have shared the Corita connection, but I feel really cheated out of what looked like it was going to be a long and fulfilling friendship. I hope he and Corita are yukking it up right now, as irreverently as possible. I am so sorry for everyone’s loss, I wish we’d had more time. Love, Sasha –Sasha Carrera
The years I spent with Donald were as sublime as it gets. We adored each other in ways that I know I will never feel again. It was a long time ago, but that time is what still makes me open to the world, creative, giving, caring. Donald changed me into the man I am. I am not sure he knew that. But I certainly do. Thanks oh thanks my sweet sweet Donald…..–David Schweizer

Donald, tell me it is a dream. None of it happened. I’ll see you soon at an opening, and you’ll say something funny and Carl will smile that loving smile and everyone will feel that the earth is in right orbit for just a moment. That is the sort of gift you have, of making it all right. there’s a whole lot of us folks who are not at all willing to accept this. May your next journey be as adventurous. You will be missed. –Rebecca Niederlander

In a presentation depicting the importance of Social Diversity Donald Krieger had a Luncheon for his Ethnic Studies Class at Fullerton College in 1974. The plates consisted of all green food. Our Instructor remarked to Donald and the class he was indeed a genius, a visionary. As his young peers this distinction was something we were all quite aware of, and will always be.
…the one who put me in the thick of the Post Avant-Garde! Donald – Stay Peaceful!
I received my first art/philosophy lesson from Donald when He was still living at home in Fullerton. He was constructing something large on the garage floor. It was being built to be dismantled, maybe to be destroyed. Why?My first lesson on inpermanance and an idea of conceptual art. Thank you, Donald.",How did Donald Krieger's peers and friends describe him in their posts on his Facebook page?,"Donald Krieger's peers and friends described him as an elegant soul who shared his thoughts and kindness generously.

1319,"New research finds that the brains of infants as young as 7 months old demonstrate a sensitivity to the human voice and to emotions communicated through the voice that is remarkably similar to what is observed in the brains of adults. The study, published by Cell Press in the March 25 issue of the journal Neuron, probes the origins of voice processing in the human brain and may provide important insight into neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism.
Dr. Tobias Grossmann from the Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development at the University of London led the study which was performed in Dr. Angela D. Friederici's laboratory at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Germany. The researchers used near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate when during development regions in temporal cortex become specifically sensitive to the human voice. These specific cortical regions have been shown to play a key role in processing spoken language in adults. Grossmann and colleagues observed that 7-month-olds but not 4-month-olds showed adult-like increased responses in the temporal cortex in response to the human voice when compared to nonvocal sounds, suggesting that voice sensitivity emerges between 4 and 7 months of age..""

139,"HLN viewers have had a lot questions about the Jodi Arias case since a mistrial was declared on May 23. HLNtv.com will answer some of the most-asked questions in a series of seven articles that will publish every day this week called Arias Trial FAQs, or frequently asked questions.
It is very difficult to say what could delay the Jodi Arias trial at this stage, because anything could happen.
The first jury couldn’t reach a unanimous decision about whether to sentence the convicted murderer to death or life in prison. So Arias is now facing a retrial for the penalty phase of her trial, and a new jury will be selected to decide what her sentence will be.
The new penalty phase of the Arias trial is scheduled to begin July 18. Judge Sherry Stephens also scheduled a status hearing on June 20 to check in with the attorneys about their preparations for the new phase of the trial.
At the June 20 hearing, either side could ask for more time to prepare their case for the retrial, and it will be up to the judge to decide if the attorneys should be given more time to prepare.
Another possible delay could occur if Stephens releases defense attorneys Kirk Nurmi and Jennifer Willmott from the case.
HLN legal experts say this is unlikely to happen, because Stephens has already denied the defense team's multiple requests to quit the case.
If for some reason Stephens does allow Nurmi and Willmott off the case, new attorneys may need more time to prepare for the retrial of the penalty phase, since they'll have to get caught up on the case and the previous phases of the trial, too. This could potentially push the start date of the retrial later than July 18.
If new defense attorneys are not given an adequate amount of time to prepare for the case, it could help Arias' appeal of ineffective counsel in regards to her sentence.
However, Stephens, who may want to avoid another delay, might not let Arias’ current attorneys, Nurmi and Willmott, off the hook., Arizona, right now.
Join the conversation...",What could potentially delay the retrial of the penalty phase in the Jodi Arias case?,"The retrial of the penalty phase in the Jodi Arias case could be delayed if either side asks for more time to prepare their case or if Judge Sherry Stephens releases defense attorneys Kirk Nurmi and Jennifer Willmott from the case. If new attorneys are assigned, they may need more time to prepare, which could push the start date of the retrial later than July 18."

The School Committee voted during its March 2 meeting to amend the school calendar. The change is a result on an ongoing effort with parents and the union to streamline the calendar as much as possible, said Superintendent Maryann Perry.
What’s the timeline?
2017/2018 School Year
What were the concerns?
Fractured school weeks due to professional development days being held mid-week and observances of religious holidays.
Parent conferences
Starting school before Labor Day
No school the Friday before Labor Day
What are the changes?
First day for staff will be Aug. 28 -- the traditional opening day event for staffers will be moved to the first full day of professional development in October.
First day for students will be Tuesday, Aug. 29
Kindergarten screening will be moved to the last week in August thus piloting new introduction to kindergarten.

Parent conferences will be shifted to one full day (Dec. 8) with one additional half day and evening conferences (Dec. 13.) The half day of conferences will be held from 1 p.m.- 4 p.m. There will be a break from dinner and teachers will come back for evening conferences from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. The high school will have a full day of professional development on Dec. 8. Perry said it will be a pilot year for the new conference schedule and she is hoping for feedback from parents and educators.
According to Perry if 2017/2018 is a quiet year for snow students could get out as early as June 22.
“If we use all five snow days students will get out on June 26 and teachers on June 27,” she said.
The School Committee approved the amended calendar unanimously with committee member Jennifer Schaeffner thanking Perry for “the enormous effort” made in achieving the changes. She said she believes it will make a big difference.
Chairman Meredith Tedford the committee would continue to keep the lines of communication open in regards to the calendar and revisit the changes as needed.",When will the first day for Kindergarten be in the 2017/2018 School Year according to the amended school calendar?,The first day for Kindergarten will be Sept. 5 in the 2017/2018 School Year according to the amended school calendar.

1326,"For our honeymoon ten years ago, we went to Toby’s favorite island in the Caribbean.
St. Barts.
It didn’t take me long to figure out why he loves this place so much. The plane ride over was breathtaking, as was the landing on the very short runway (because I was holding my breath). There’s the vibrant landscape, the soothing trade winds, the white sand (nude) beaches, the French take on Caribbean food, the winding roads along steep cliffs, the view at every turn. It was all those things, plus one more.
The best rum.
After long days in the sun, we spent our evenings at little open-air restaurants that serve up grilled lobsters and vichyssoise. Once our plates were cleared, the waiter would bring a bottle of rum to the table, along with two little glasses. Sometimes homemade vanilla rum, sometimes passionfruit. I thought they were both delicious, but Toby was all about that passionfruit. You could see the seeds swirling around in the bottle. We even brought some home with us, and once we ran out, I started making my own.
Passionfruit, also known as lilikoi, are funny little fruits. They’re ripe when the outside skin gets wrinkly. Once you slice them open, each one only contains a spoonful of pulp and seeds, but one little taste has so much concentrated tropical flavor. They’re more tart than sweet.
Just a few passionfruit will add so much flavor to one quart of rum. I also add a hint of lime zest and a bit of vanilla, just because. It’s slightly sweetened with cane syrup, but not so much that it’s watered down. It’s still got enough proof to pack a punch. The seeds are perfectly edible and have a very light crunch, but of course you can strain them out if you like.
Serve it over ice with a few slices of tropical fruit, maybe some mint leaves. That’s just to make it pretty, though, because once you taste it you’ll see it needs nothing at all. If you close your eyes, it tastes like a Caribbean sunset.
My recipe format isn’t working for me today, so for now I’m writing this one the old fashioned way…
Passionfruit Rum
1 cup granulated natural cane sugar
1 cup water
5 ripe passionfruit (lilikoi)
zest of 1 lemon or lime
1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise, or 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups Caribbean rum
Bring the sugar and water to a boil in a small saucepan. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until it reduces, about 10 minutes, then allow it to cool.
Slice each passionfruit in half and scoop out the seeds into a quart-sized mason jar. Add the zest and vanilla. Pour in the rum and sugar syrup.
Give it a good stir, then put a lid on it. Allow it to sit for at least 2 weeks, if possible.
Serve it up with or without ice, and garnish with mint leaves or tropical fruit slices if you’re feeling fancy.
Cheers!
Yummy. And your pictures are gorgeous – what a beautiful place!
Thank you, Nicole, and yes, that place is so beautiful! I can’t wait to go back.
Danielle you need to bring some of that with you next time you are down on Pine Island!
Deal!
I bring the rum, you bring your girls!
Better have some left when I visit next week!
Toby’s waiting to share it with you!
You’re killing me with this! Passion fruit is my all time favorite. Rum too. 😉 I’m totally going to try and make this. I would love to see St. Barts some day – adding it to my (very long) list.
PS: I’ve been having trouble with my recipes lately, too. Are you using the recipe card plug in? I wonder what’s going on.
I was drooling over your tropical soul bowls complete with halves of passionfruit! Is there any other fruit that packs that much flavor? St. Barts is paradise. I have no doubt you’d love it.
I have no idea what the deal is with the Recipe Card plugin. Mine is from Yumprint. I emailed them but of course no response.
Yep, same thing. I just tried updating my recipe for tomorrow and it’s still not working. Super frustrating. I also e-mailed with no response. Will let you know if I hear anything. At least we have passion fruit (and you have rum).
I just read some WP support forums. Yumprint website is down. Everyone’s having the same problem. I hope they get it together, but in the mean time, you’re right. I do have rum. Cheers, Coley!
I love love LOVE passion fruit. And I would love it even more with rum! This would be a great Oscar’s night cocktail!
I agree, Stacy! Cheers!",What are the ingredients and steps to make Passionfruit Rum?,"The ingredients for Passionfruit Rum are 1 cup granulated natural cane sugar, 1 cup water, 5 ripe passionfruit (lilikoi), zest of 1 lemon or lime, 1 vanilla bean or 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, and 2 1/2 cups Caribbean rum.

It seems to fix these bugs and security issues in a very unique way - on all the machines at our office that have been updated, it's actually uninstalled the Adobe Reader 8 application completely.
Perhaps not the intended result, but certainly seems to fix the bugs from previous versions!
Quite why anyone has not ditched Acrobat reader for Foxit is beyond me.
...to uninstall it.
Adobe Reader is such a loathesome pile of overweight lard. I binned in favour of Foxit reader. No more weird exceptions and browser hangs.
Paris, 'cos she's dainty, unlike Adobe Reader.
...and Acrobat 8 is no exception. It's even more bloated and buggy than Acrobat 7 which takes some doing....?
For anyone on dial-up wanting to install this 32MB update, note that the full install is ""only"" 22MB.
Go on, Adobe, explain that!
What I've always wondered is why the hell does it want to install a desktop icon. I mean, it's almost unique as an application you practically _never_ want to run directly, yet one of the more aggressive in providing you with the means to. Self-importance is indeed the only feasible explanation.
@Matthew:
The reason some of us carry on enduring Adobe's horrid reader is because Foxit's free version lacks a couple of features, e.g. you can't ""Save as Text"".
?""
Well, since people often use Reader to view documents from the web, being out of date places the users at risk. So the software checks for updates by default, to protect the users. There is a simple reg file available from the Adobe knowledge base which disables the updater, if it bothers you.
The product is also slightly larger than it could be, because it contains many Acrobat features, which paying Adobe customers can switch on (search Reader Extensions). There are very few things which are truly free, lots of products like this are given away as a mechanism to encourage the sale of paid products. Foxit is no exception.
In this case, you are getting Adobe Reader free so that companies who want to make forms which offer web service and database connectivity, the local saving of filled forms, commenting and more don't need to buy everybody they send a form to a copy of Acrobat.
I used to think of Reader was bloated software, until I realised just how much was possible with the right amount of kerching.
But as for this update, I agree with the sentiments... botched is a good word. No details of security fixes, massive file size, no incremental available. Hopefully they will issue an apology for this debacle.
""There is a simple reg file available from the Adobe knowledge base which disables the updater, if it bothers you.""
A registry patch? Why? What's wrong with the more usual approach of an installer option? Or a preference switch?
Foxit looks great on Windows. Not so on Linux. If anyone can suggest a Linux PDF reader which a) has a search function, and b) is available in rpm form, I'm all ears.
""A registry patch? Why? What's wrong with the more usual approach of an installer option? Or a preference switch?""
I only know how to switch it off from deploying on a large scale, where the last thing you want is automatic updates kicking of as and when they want. I expect you probably can disable it from within the app, but I've never felt the need to find out.
If you want to find out how to disable it using the GUI method, find someone who actually runs the software on Windows... I use Reader on Linux, and get my updates through my standard distro repositories.... Adobe doesn't even bother to -make- an automatic updater for the Linux versions as far as I'm aware.
My suggestion for a PDF Reader for Linux which looks amazing, has a very powerful search, is available in RPM and is in the non-OSS repo for most distros by default, and has the best support for all of the latest and greatest PDF features is.... Adobe Reader 8.1.2!
:).
I know Wikipedia is a dirty word but you can't argue with this:
I believe my PDF reader is evince - it's whatever is the default PDF reader out of the box when you install Ubuntu. It can't be too bad since I've never noticed it, or had any cause to care what it is - just how I like my software.
Rich: you might have tried it before but if not I think it might well be worth a look for you. Not sure how it is for search but it's free.
And re: ""In (partial) defence of Adobe Reader... "" - there are tons of things that are truly free. Evince is just one example. Practically every piece of software I use on a regular basis, outside of work, is Free (big F) and all of it is free (small f). The only non-FOSS software I use is the display driver on one of my laptops. I used to have a flash plugin as well but they don't do a 64 bit linux binary of that so I didn't install it on my new box ... and haven't missed it.
I use xpdf on Linux, which has a search function. I don't know about RPMs because I compile almost all my stuff from source.
For some reason, my version totally ignores those annoying ""can't print this document"" and ""can't copy/paste this document"" flags. Can't imagine why...
And I also can't imagine why the f*ck anyone would make a PDF then not allow you to print it, but then that's my stupid credit card company and their PDF statements.
@Rich
As a Fedora user I read pdfs using Evince. Naturally it comes as an rpm, you should be able to build your own rpm if the Fedora rpm is unsuitable.
GhostScript.
Views PostScript and PDF files and can convert between the two a treat.
And it's free.

Before I start let me give a background of myself. I bought GMod in 2014 and I saw YouTube videos of this gamemode called GMod Tower. I thought it looked super cool so I downloaded the addons and connected. Instantly I was in love with it. I met many people, played many games, and designed my condo. A couple years after, I hear about the reveal of Lobby 2. At this point I freaked out. When it was released I played so much. I got my friends to join me and we would play for hours. The next spring, my computer broke, and at this time the Kickstarter/Indiegogo was released and I sadly missed it and I will never be able to forgive myself for missing it. I ended up buying a prebuilt (that sucked really bad) and I was able to play GMTower with my friends again, at 30fps. Then if Feburary, I see the Steam reveal. At this point I was hyped. After long months of waiting, it was released. I bought the game immediately, but there was a file error (if anyone remembers that), so I went back on GMTower. It was so laggy from so much activity that I disconnected and waited for the file fix for Tower Unite. When it was fixed, I downloaded the game and immediately played virus with many and it was great. Months go by, and in August of 2016, I built my new PC with literally 3 things in mind, the ability to run GTA V at high+ graphics, run Overwatch at Epic, and Tower Unite at all TURBO. I was finally able to play the game and it was amazing. Another little funny thing that happened was in February of 2017, my favorite Twitch streamers, JoshOG and Summit1G, bought Tower Unite, with their other two friends WitWix and Dyrus. I got to play with them and I beat Summit and JoshOG in bowling. That was so funny to me.
That's pretty much my story!
Thanks for reading and thank you developers for all your time on this amazing game.
I know this is late from the games 1 year anniversary, but I didn't want this to go to waste.
I would also like to thank the community. You guys are amazing and I love playing with you all.
From,VinTheHero
I just bought the game yesterday, though I played GMOD tower alone time ago and this is a blast! Hope to see you in-game one day and grats on the victory! Hope you keep having fun! ;p

Drug Enforcement Administration
The CSA places all substances which were in some manner regulated under existing
federal law into one of five schedules. This placement).
Proceedings to add, delete, or change the schedule of a drug or other substance may be
initiated by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS), or by petition from any interested party: agency also may begin an investigation of a drug at any time based upon information
received from law enforcement laboratories, state and local law enforcement and regulatory
agencies, or other sources of information.
Once the DEA has collected the necessary data, the Administrator of the DEA, by
authority of the Attorney General, requests from HHS a scientific and medical evaluation
and recommendation as to whether the drug or other substance should be controlled or
removed from control. This request is sent to the Assistant Secretary of Health of HHS.
HHS solicits information from the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),
evaluationsand recommendations from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and on occasion
from the scientific and medical community at large. The Assistant Secretary, by authority
of the Secretary, compiles information, transmits back to the DEA a medical and scientific
evaluation regarding the drug or other substance, a recommendation as to whether the drug
should be controlled, and in what schedule it should be placed.
The medical and scientific evaluations are binding on the DEA with respect to
scientific and medical matters. The recommendation on scheduling is binding only to the
extent that if HHS recommends that substance not be controlled, the DEA may not control
the substance.
Once the DEA has received the scientific and medical evaluation from HHS, the
Administrator will evaluate all available data and make a final decision whether to
propose that a drug or other substance should be controlled and into which schedule it
should be placed.
The threshold issue is whether the drug or other substance has potential for abuse. If
a drug does not have a potential for abuse, it cannot be controlled. Although the term
""potential for abuse"" is not defined in CSA, there is much discussion of the
term in the legislative history of the Act. The following items are indicators that a drug
or other substance has a potential for abuse:
In determining into which schedule a drug or other substance should be placed, or
whether a substance should be decontrolled or rescheduled, certain factors are required to
be considered. Specific findings are not required for each factor. These factors are
listed in Section 201 (c), [21 U.S.C. 811 (c)], of the CSA and are as follows:
After considering the above listed factors, the Administrator must make specific
findings concerning the drug or other substance. This will determine into which schedule
the drug or other substance will be placed. These schedules are established by the CSA.
When the Administrator of DEA has determined that a drug or other substance should be
controlled, decontrolled, or rescheduled, a proposal to take action is published in the
Federal Register. The proposal invites all interested persons to file comments with the
DEA. Affected parties may also request a hearing with the DEA. If no hearing is requested,
the DEA will evaluate all comments received and publish a final order in the Federal
Register, controlling the drug as proposed or with modifications based upon the written
comments filed. This order will set the effective dates for imposing the various
requirements imposed under the CSA.
If a hearing is requested, the DEA will enter into discussions with the party or
parties requesting a hearing in an attempt to narrow the issue for litigation. If
necessary, a hearing will then be held before an Administrative Law Judge. The judge will
take evidence on factual issues and hear arguments on legal questions regarding the
control of the drug. Depending on the scope and complexity of the issues, the hearing may
be brief or quite extensive. The Administrative Law Judge, at the close of the hearing,
prepares findings of fact and conclusions of law and a recommended decision which is
submitted to the Administrator of DEA. The Administrator will review these documents, as
well as the underlying material, and prepare his/her own findings of fact and conclusions
of law (which may or may not be the same as those drafted by the Administrative Law
Judge). The Administrator then publishes a final order in the Federal Register either
scheduling the drug or other substance or declining to do so.
Once the final order is published in the Federal Register, interested parties have 30
days to appeal to a U.S. Court of Appeals to challenge the order. Findings of fact by the
Administrator are deemed conclusive if supported by ""substantial evidence."" The
order imposing controls is not stayed during the appeal, however, unless so ordered by the
Court.

1401,"We talk so often about breakups, but rarely do we discuss the breakups we experience from friends, whether we leave the friendship or are kicked aside. I have a group of women friends without whom I would be utterly lost. I can’t take all the inane crap that runs through my head to my husband. I need them. Losing one of them would be like a romantic relationship breakup, whether that sounds weird to you or not.
I share my life, my hopes, my dreams, my fears, with these women. To no longer have that person, to no longer be able to be there for that person, is hard to imagine. And yet, it happens, for various reasons. Kids, husbands, moving. Relationships change. People change. Friendships evolve. Sometimes, unfortunately, the evolution is only one-sided and one friend decides the friendship is no longer worth the effort. It hurts.
I’ve lost and left friends for various reasons. There was the time a friend thought I didn’t want to repay her a small loan. There was the time a friend refused to repay me a small loan. There was the time I wasn’t being a good enough friend. There was the time a friend I spent every day with went underground after high school without a word and didn’t resurface until two years ago. The HerStories Project presents in September My Other Ex: Women’s True Stories of Leaving and Losing Friends. I’m proud to say I’m included in this anthology with a piece about losing a friendship and having no choice in the matter. Ties were severed, burned, stepped on, shredded, then littered into a landfill of friendship resumption impossibility.
The book is available for pre-sale now. It is filled with heartfelt, exploratory, and funny tales of friendship loss between women. Order it. You won’t be sorry. My piece, especially, isn’t typical. Shocking, I know.
This actually sounds like a great book….heading over to read now.
We loved your piece! Right away we loved your style when we first read your piece. And can I just say that your title would have been a great alternate title for the book: “Some of My Exes are Women”? Thanks so much for being a part of our little HerStories Project community!
Yep, we do have women exes. Friends for a reason, season , lifetime. Your usual writing excellence.
I am so proud to be with you in this book. To have my name alongside Arnebya Herndon – YES PLEASE.
I’m so excited for you! Just pre-ordered.
Oh yes, yes, yes. I can’t remember most of my boyfriends by now, even though the break ups seemed monumental at the time. But I still hurt from the friend I lost. I still talk about it. It’s been almost 20 years, and I still can’t believe the friendship is over. Sounds like this book is for me.
I’m thrilled for you. I’m still pained by one friendship break up in particular. It still eats away at me.
I lost a best friend. And it was 100% my fault. Well, 99.
Small comfort.
I think I am a good friend now; even a very-good one. But there were times when…I wasn’t.
Youth. Selfishness. Hormones. Loneliness. Plenty of excuses swim in my head.
But the deep-down reason that makes me burn with shame is that I was a not-good person.
I’ve been trying, since, to be better. I am better. Perhaps that’s my silver lining.
In any case, your essay will be brilliant (everything you write opens me up) and I will probably cry when I read these stories. That’s not a bad thing, though. Sometimes, we need to cry.
I know how this goes. I do have an “other ex” as well. I’m definitely interested in reading all of these, but especially yours.
Congratulations (on being in the anthology, not on losing a friend). xo","What is the main theme of the anthology ""My Other Ex: Women’s True Stories of Leaving and Losing Friends""?","The main theme of the anthology ""My Other Ex: Women’s True Stories of Leaving and Losing Friends"" is the experiences of women dealing with the loss and departure from friendships."
1453,"Written by: Carmina Lass, Director of Training and Consulting for Credit Builders Alliance
In today’s economy, a good credit history is a financial asset. Distinct from debt – which is a liability defined by what we owe – credit is a measure of our financial health and increasingly influences lenders and others on who they decide to do business with and under what terms and conditions. Having good credit benefits individuals and their families by: creating opportunities to save, improving housing and employment options, buffering economic shocks, improving access to high-quality credit products, and expanding opportunities for asset building.
Unfortunately, for many people with poor credit history (or none at all), it can be difficult to access affordable financial products and services, purchase assistive technology, obtain rental housing and secure opportunities to build wealth through home ownership, pursuit of higher education, and small business ownership.
If you or the people that you work with have ever struggled with credit issues you know that credit and debt management can be overwhelming and confusing at first. However, improving and rebuilding credit history is possible for anyone who is willing to take the first crucial step: create an action plan.
The natural starting place for rebuilding credit is to pull and thoroughly review your free credit report. You can pull your free credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus once per year by visiting.
Reviewing the credit report in detail is critical to getting a clear picture of your credit profile, in order to decide the next best steps for improving or rebuilding your credit history. Once you are empowered with the knowledge of what is on your report, you can then create a personal action plan, broken down into bite-sized pieces which may include:
- disputing any errors and inaccuracies that appear on the report;
- getting open delinquent accounts back on track;
- creating a budget and plan to prioritize and pay off outstanding debts, including collection accounts and public records;
- identifying opportunities to establish new positive credit accounts with responsible lenders.
Rebuilding credit history takes time and dedication; make sure to avoid “credit repair” services that make any promises about guaranteed credit score improvement or quick results, or any service that charges upfront fees. Oftentimes these companies charge for services that you can actually do yourself, for free. When in doubt as to how to address complicated credit issues, the best place to turn for help is to an accredited non-profit consumer credit counseling agency or a trusted non-profit organization that provides financial coaching services.

I would wager nearly 75-80% of all balcony window boxes contain them so I figured they needed a little attention.
Was kind of bummed that my Edding Marker exploded while journaling. You see a major smear starting between the words ""think"" and ""about"" and then it carries down to ""but"" and ""people.""
I think they just got too hot in the car or something. They all seemed to give me trouble. They smeared all over the pages and sadly also had major leak-through to the backsides.
Note to self: use better paper.
I wouldn't worry about exploding markers, some of the best art is produced when an accident happens. I recently did a painting that really didn't look that great at all and I was trying to talk my cat into walking all over it so that at least some interesting random shapes would be introduced on it, but she wasn't interested. Shame really, I just know the painting would have improved greatly. I might try going over it with a leaking marker pen and just see what happens.

Fantastic!
I made this last night. My family of 4 (3 boys) had only one complaint. I didn't make enough. My only modification to the recipe is that I retained about 2 cups of the soup (picking out the potatoes) prior to pureeing in the blender. My guys like to be able to chew on something in their soup. They aren't fans of purely cream soups, at least not as a main course. After pureeing the rest I returned the two cups of soup to the pot.

It’s something that I don’t really understand, how we can take these magnificent animals out of their environment and put them in swimming pools. That was my biggest challenge, was actually to be cool during those days.”
The stunningly beautiful 37-year-old star may have not been able to connect with Stéphanie’s ability to work with whales in captivity, what she didn’t have a hard time with was finding ways to connect to the spirit of her character and her many struggles. In addition to her injury, Stéphanie falls for a handsome, but troubled single father Ali (Matthias Schoenaerts) and their tumultuous relationship both burdens her and sets her free. Cotillard says that her Rust and Bone character is “much more violent than,” than she is in real life, but she understands that through violence people can release themselves from pain. “I had a period of my life when I questioned existence. I had so many questions and there was no answer and I was kind of lost. I didn’t know what to do with myself, I didn’t know why I was alive.”
But those very questions of existence and the “Whys?”, like the ones Stéphanie continually asks herself and others, can lead to something quite unexpected. “There’s a process of self-destruction when you don’t get those answers because you don’t know if you’ll ever get them,” Cotillard says. “Before you find something that allows you not to worry anymore about those answers, that thing is most of the time, love,” she says of her character’s journey, both with herself and in her unique relationship with Ali. “When you hit the bottom and there’s nothing left but yourself to face, you abandon a lot of bulls**t. You get straight to the point, you’re up front, you have no time to lose with not saying things or saying things in a very complicated way. She tells what she feels because that’s who she is now.”
But it’s those very complications that draws the Oscar-winner — whose film credits in 2012 ranged from the small, intimate Rust and Bone to the blockbuster The Dark Knight Rises — to her projects. “I love complexity, that’s really what I’m attracted to. With [Stéphanie] …she was such a mystery when I read the script for the first time. I thought, ‘Well she could be a lot of people.’ There’s very little information about her, about where she comes from, about her family, about her past, there’s almost nothing. So we really had to create almost everything about her and to find the authenticity, to find who she is and that was an amazing journey because when you do this with such a brilliant director [Jacques Audiard], it’s very inspiring.”
Cotillard gives a lot of the credit to Audiard (whose brutal and brilliant A Prophet earned an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Film in 2010) for making the heaviness of the film work. “Jacques is this mix of a very grounded person and at the same time, a great poet seeking authenticity in everything he does and I loved working with him.” Cotillard has spoken before about the importance of a great director to a project, like she did during The Hollywood Reporter’s recent actress’ roundtable. (“I realized that if I don’t trust the director, if I don’t like him, I’m going to be bad.”)
At that same roundtable, Cotillard found herself surrounded by the very women who are earning accolades for their work in film this year. The very same women she’ll face off with this awards season, including other Globes nominees Naomi Watts, Anne Hathaway, Sally Field, Amy Adams, Rachel Weisz, and Helen Hunt. But, that’s not the way Cotillard sees it. “I’m the biggest actresses lover! I love actresses, I’ve always felt a connection [to them]. We share something in that we play our emotions and we tell women’s stories.”

Lovely, Pollly! Beautiful artwork and uplifting thoughts.
When one of my daughters was a teenager she asked me what my ambitions were. I answered that it was to enjoy seeing her and her siblings grow up. She asked me why I didn’t have any ambitions for myself!
That set me thinking in a new direction and shortly after that I embarked on a degree course with the Open University. (I hadn’t been to university when I left school). This is a distance learning establishment and one can study alongside working full time, as I was at that time. I absolutely loved learning new things and enjoyed the challenges along the way.
So yes, try new things and limit less!
Love this message – it definitely spoke to me!

What every city council should be focusing its time on: Roosters. The Los Angeles City Council is taking on the issue of limiting one rooster per property because the birds are noisy, dirty and used in animal fights, City News Service reports.
Los Angeles Seeks Limits on Roosters
By ALICE WALTON
City News Service
LOS ANGELES - Concerned that roosters are noisy, dirty and often used in animal fights, the Los Angeles City Council today discussed a plan to restrict ownership of the birds to one per property.
The city's Animal Cruelty Task Force was instructed to report back in 30 days on the
ramifications of limiting possession of roosters, but not chickens.
Neighbors complain that roosters can be noisy and create sanitation issues, and Animal
Services officials warn that in many cases, roosters are used for cock-fighting.
""Animal Services has told me they receive 50 complaints a day about roosters,"" said City
Councilwoman Janice Hahn.
I wonder how the number of complaint calls compare to, say, graffiti.
And some of you laughed at me at the my random Craigslist blog post. I just call it foreshadowing on the story that Amanda Baumfeld reported today..""
Its been a busy past few days with water stories, fire and more water stories. So, I finally got a minute to breathe, and the top story of the day: teen queen Miley Cyrus, aka Hannah Montana, is wrapped up naked in an American flag.
I love Craigslist. I shouldn't, since it is one of the reasons why newspapers are dying. But I am a little bit addicted. No, not to the erotic section where you can find a prostitute. But I have used Craigslist to find roommates, activity partners and softball teams. In most cases, Craigslist has improved my life. When I first moved down to West Covina, I turned to Craigslist to find a roommate. When I needed to sell my bike, I found a good buyer off of Craigslist. When I was looking for freelance gigs, I found them on Craigslist.
But now that I think about it, I've put a little bit too much faith in the Web site.
Like last night, for example. I've been wanting to find a rock climbing partner, but everyone in my newsroom circle just looks at me cross eyed when I ask them to go climbing. So I turned to Craigslist. There was an add looking for a bouldering partner. I responded, called the guy and we agreed to meet at The Arc, a rock climbing gym in Arcadia. When I told my friends that I was meeting a guy who is a total stranger at the gym, they were convinced that I was going to be murdered. The guy ended up being totally normal -- not even a perv or a killer. The only downside is that, apparently, it was ""date night"" at the gym, and everyone kept on thinking that we were a couple. He was about 120 pounds and 5'5, whereas I am 5'7 and 150 pounds. Pretty unlikely couple.
And then there is the softball team I play on. I repsonded to an add looking for another female for the team. The team was in Covina, worked with my schedule and was cheap, so I figured, why not? After I agreed to play, the coach of the team said, ""Well, let me tell you a little bit about the team. Most of us are former narcotics anonymous members..."" Oh great. So I guess pizza and beer after the game is out of the question.
The team -- which hasn't won a game in four seasons -- has ended up being extremely entertaining. Whether it's the outfielder who plays while smoking a ciggarette, the parents whose child was just expelled for bringing a butcher knife to school or the couple of guys that have spent a combined 20 years in prison, there's plenty to talk about.
Oh yeah, and then there was the roommate search in the summer. The ""best"" roommate I found off Craigslist ended up robbing our house on my birthday, then staying in the house for about one month before I evicted her. I know, I know. I am a reporter, I should have known better. But I was desperate.
But even after the last six months of questionable finds on Craigslist, I know that when newspapers are finally dead, I have a Web site to include in my job hunt.",What issue is the Los Angeles City Council focusing on regarding roosters?,"The Los Angeles City Council is focusing on the issue of limiting one rooster per property because the birds are noisy, dirty and used in animal fights."
534,"Will I Lose My Bona Fide Resident Status When I Move?
If you have already been recognized as a bona fide resident of another country, you maintain qualification for the FEIE in the new country of residency.
One of the many ways that US Expats save money on their US expat tax returns is to claim the FEIE (Foreign Earned Income Exclusion). In order to qualify for this huge exclusion, you must be able to pass either the Physical Presence Test or the Bona Fide Residence Test. If you have already qualified as a bona fide resident in one country, what happens to your bona fide resident status if you move to another country?
You may still move around the world as long as you have no intention of moving back to the United States.
In order to meet the requirements of the Bona Fide Residence test, you must be living in a foreign country for a full year and have no intentions of moving back to the United States in the near future. The country in which you reside doesn’t necessarily have to stay the same for you to meet the conditions of the Bona Fide Residence Test; you just have to have established a tax home in a foreign country.
It doesn’t take much to prove that you have created a tax abode in a foreign country.
When the IRS takes a look at your foreign residency, they look for a variety of indications that you have established a tax abode in a country outside of the United States. This means that the location of your financial account(s) is in your host country, you have professional affiliations in your host country, you are a member of one or more groups or organizations, you maintain a household, etc.
Assume you are living in Finland. If you take a trip to Italy for an extended period of time, you must maintain your tax abode in Finland. If you are planning on moving to Italy for good, you must establish a tax home in that country. If you are planning on going on a short trip to the United States or to another country, you don’t have to worry about creating a tax abode in another country as long as you plan on returning to your host country.
It’s important to realize that you must have every intention of returning to the place where your tax home is established once you are finished with your vacation. The IRS looks at the facts. If you are living overseas and you maintain your foreign home while you are temporarily residing in or visiting another country, this is suitable evidence to the IRS that your intention is to live in the country in which your tax abode is established.
The bona fide residence test may not be feasible for certain types of work; you may be able to meet the conditions of the Physical Presence Test.
The rules surrounding the Bona Fide Residence Test is the very reason that contractors find it difficult to qualify. Contractors are generally on temporary work assignments overseas. These assignments can last anywhere between a few months to a year or longer. Typically speaking, the contractor leaves everything as it is in the United States; family remains behind, domestic bank accounts remain open, etc. If you are a contractor and you are outside of the country on a temporary assignment for at least 330 days out of a period of 365 days, you will qualify for the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion by meeting the conditions of the Physical Presence Test.",What are the requirements to meet the Bona Fide Residence Test for the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion?,"In order to meet the requirements of the Bona Fide Residence test, you must be living in a foreign country for a full year and have no intentions of moving back to the United States in the near future. The country in which you reside doesn’t necessarily have to stay the same; you just have to have established a tax home in a foreign country."
1208,"Former sugar-cane mill was ‘home’ for some
Ralph Miller talks about the time he spent working at Caldwell Sugars Co-op Tuesday afternoon at the site of the old mill, just north of Thibodaux.Abby Tabor/Staff
Published: Wednesday, December 29, 2010 at 11:01 a.m.
Last Modified: Wednesday, December 29, 2010 at 11:01 a.m.
- Editor’s note: One in a series on local institutions, traditions that no longer exist.
THIBODAUX — Caldwell Plantation Road is a poorly maintained gravel path off La. 308 that sees little traffic. Decrepit houses, invaded by tall yellowed grass, and idle tractors, some that appear to have been undisturbed for years, line the road that once led to a booming business.
“I never thought I’d see the day,” said Ralph Miller, staring at the remains of Caldwell Sugars Co-op, a once sprawling sugar-cane mill just north of Thibodaux. Today, a lone gray smoke stack stands like a sentinel over the mill’s crumbled remains.
Miller, 75, worked at Caldwell Co-op from 1955 to 1965, 10 “hard years but some of the best years of my life.” He was in charge of payroll.
Caldwell Co-op was formed in 1946 after 23 sugar-cane farmers pledged more than $302,000 and bought Caldwell Sugars’ assets, including a refinery and four plantations.
The Co-op was in operation for 55 years. It closed in 2002.
When Miller stares at the bulldozed remnants, he said he is filled with memories of what used to be there.
Workers lived on the plantation property. The entire area, Miller said, was a self-sufficient, contained community.
“Everybody was dependent on each other,” he said. “It was just like a city of its own. I just hated to see it closed.”
Workers were provided with free housing, which helped stretch Miller’s $68 biweekly paycheck. There was also a company store.
Trips into Thibodaux were rare, he said, because the workers and their families had most of what they needed on the property.
“It was just so well coordinated,” he said.
In January 2000, members of Caldwell, Glenwood Cooperative in Napoleonville and St. James Sugar Cooperative in St. James merged, creating South Louisiana Sugars Cooperative. The board decided to upgrade Glenwood and St. James and shut down the Caldwell mill, according to a 2002 Daily Comet article.
The closure left Lafourche Parish with only two sugar-cane mills, Lafourche Sugars in Thibodaux and Raceland Raw Sugar.
Caldwell was, one local history professor said, one of the last holdouts of a culture that has slowly faded in Louisiana.
“You have to look at the decline as a trend that’s been going on possibly since the introduction of sugar in Louisiana back in the early 19th century,” said Paul Leslie, a retired Nicholls State University history professor. “It’s a trend based on consolidation.”
In 1977, Lafourche was home to six sugar mills. In 1978, that number dropped to five; and in 1980, three, according to the same Daily Comet article.
“This is a trend that has hit the automobile industry, too,” Leslie said. “Bigness became a way by which to improve efficiency. (Caldwell) just found themselves in a bind. They couldn’t find enough cane to justify their existence.”
The mill’s closure still surprised some.
“Even though we left there, I never thought I’d see the day when they closed it,” said Ray Boudreaux, who lived on the planation property for the first 18 years of his life. “It was a good life. It was nothing easy, but it was a good life.”
Boudreaux, whose father worked at the mill “basically until he died,” said sugar dominated day-to-day life.
“When I was a kid, that’s all we knew,” he said. “We didn’t think of any other kind of work. At one time, we had almost everyone in the family working there.”
He said the mill workers — his neighbors — helped make a vibrant, friendly community.
Hundreds of workers lived in individual houses and in a larger boarding house that no longer exists.
“Everybody knew one another. People were people then,” he said. “I got a house here and I got a house in New Orleans, and I’d trade it all to get back.",When did Caldwell Sugars Co-op cease operations?,Caldwell Sugars Co-op ceased operations in 2002.

2059,"A series of murders involving British nationals in Kenya in recent weeks has raised concerns over whether conditions in the east African country are deteriorating again. The British Foreign Office has warned Britons to be mindful of increased risks in Kenya.
These most recent slayings resulted from botched robberies and, in two instances, the victims were former members of the British military – Lt. Col. David Parkinson and Col. Edward Loden. Kenya is a popular destination for British travelers, attracting more than 200,000 visitors each year. Crime rates, however, are very high.
A memorial for Parkinson this month brought renewed attention to these crimes, as he was a popular and well-liked member of the expatriate community in Northern Kenya. Parkinson worked on nature reserves, including the one where Prince William proposed to Kate Middleton, and was active in supporting refugees displaced during the turmoil of the disputed 2007 elections, which led to more than 1,000 deaths. Two weeks ago, he was hacked to death with machetes at his home outside Nairobi. Parkinson’s widow has called for the gang responsible for her husband’s murder to be brought to justice. In addition to his computer and cellphone, the attackers made off with only the few dollars that Parkinson had on him at the time.
Shortly after Parkinson’s death, Loden, who was visiting his son in Kenya, was shot by a group of burglars who forced their way into the family compound in Nairobi and made away with jewelry and money. His son Jamie, who also served in the same British army regiment as his father and Parkinson, works for Barclays Bank.
Kenya wrestles with tensions stemming from deep internal divisions. Notably, the Kenyan government this week withdrew from the International Criminal Court in protest of charges being brought against both President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto, involving crimes against humanity and other offenses related to inter-tribal violence following the 2007 election. Opponents in 2007, Kenyatta and Ruto were successful allies in this year’s election, although Kenyatta only won re-election by a very slim margin.
As is often the case with contemporary Africa, rhetoric and propaganda share center stage with serious questions over accountability and commitment to democratic values. Allegations of racism and neocolonialism are being bandied about by supporters of Kenyatta and Ruto, since the ICC’s focus to date has been primarily on African leaders. Notably, though, when President Barack Obama toured Africa earlier this year, he made a point of avoiding the country of his father’s birth, causing great embarrassment to Kenya and to President Kenyatta. Obama’s snub was meant to convey a message about the seriousness of the allegations from the ICC and the failure of the government in Nairobi to adequately respond to the charges.
Africa faces massive challenges in the 21st century. Many of these stem from the colonial period in the 19th century, multiplied by the copious errors and omissions of the 20th century. However, there is still ample room to criticize a series of modern leaders who have failed to take adequate steps to institutionalize democracy, rule of law and civil society.
It would be a grave mistake, though, to write off Africa. Despite the obstacles they currently face, these countries, including Kenya, still have vast potential. But, in the face of American indifference, China is taking the opportunity to invest both time and money to strengthen its relationships on the continent. The difficult question for the United States and Europe is whether, given the strong historical ties that the West has to Africa, they are willing to make Africa a priority in the near term, rather than just a vague charitable endeavor in the medium-to-long term.
The connection that Britain still has to Kenya is tangible and real. With sufficient attention and priority, these historical and cultural ties could be harnessed by Kenyans to assist them in overcoming their various challenges. The recent killings, however, risk driving these countries further apart.
For a cautionary tale of what happens to an African country that categorically rejects the international community and recedes into its own insular cocoon, one needs look no further than Zimbabwe. Contrary to the thumping speeches of Robert Mugabe, targeting white settlers for escalating violence has not proven to be a sure-fire recipe for Zimbabwe’s fast-track development.
Kenya’s great potential should not be further postponed by allowing it to descend again into a downward spiral of violence. All Kenyans deserve better..",Who were the two former members of the British military that were victims of recent murders in Kenya?,The two former members of the British military that were victims of recent murders in Kenya were Lt.

1535,"In this episode of the mini-series of blogs on Climate Change, we hear from Daniel Mpanduzi, founder and director of CRED Partner ‘The Voice School Trust’ in Tanzania, as he reflects on the impact of climate change on his country, and the work of TVST.
IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN TANZANIA
By Daniel Mpanduzi
The Voice School Trust
Some of the sectors mostly affected:
- Agriculture and Animal husbandry
- Water and vegetation
- Health
- Tourism
- The agriculture and animal farming sectors are directly affected by climate change in Tanzania. Unreliable rains, regular drought and in some areas/cases unprecedented flood leading to soil infertility. This is causing serious poor crop production leading to food insecurity, alarming threats of hunger and increased levels of poverty as many people in the country rely on agriculture and subsistence farming for food and their livelihood. With this, The Voice School is farming project directly affected. For instance, we had very poor harvest this year due to prolonged drought. This coming farming season is not promising either; quite unusual not getting early rain up to this moment. Basic food prices are on the raise thus our overheard or school running cost are on the rise too. In some neighbouring households, they cannot afford three meals a day. The food insecurity has far reaching effects to our students’ attendance in schools. Some children are forced to join their parents in low paying daily jobs for food sake.
This is our maize farm in Monduli, which ended up with nothing this year. All the crops failed.

Our forty acres’ beans farm produced only 50 bags this time round; Is like every single acre produced an average of 1 bag; huge loss!

2. Rich pastures and sources of water are drying up due to increased levels of Temperature. This leads to scarce or completely luck of drinking water for human beings, animals and even for domestic uses in many areas in the country. This is pausing a huge Health threat to so many people especially in rural Tanzania. Water and pasture disappearance is increasingly affecting the Livestock industry in the country particularly in areas like Arusha, Mara and Simiyu, regions which largely practice animal farming.
Picture by Millardayo.
This is making so many animal keepers move from one region to another (e.g. some move from Simiyu in the North to Mbeya down South of the country) in search of water and pasture, a practice which is causing them lots of conflicts with crop producers. So much time is also used walking long distances in search of water and pasture. This practice affects women and children who spend most of their time searching for water and grazing areas instead of going to school.
This is a water dam in Singa Village, Mkalama, Singida – it should be full of water.
Picture by Kajunason
3. Climate change is also encouraging invasion of a number of new forms of pests in our farms’ – another food insecurity threat! We have recently witnessed clouds and waves of locust and other crop eating pests which have never been witnessed before.
4. Kilimanjaro is known to be the roof of Africa found in Tanzania. It is the highest Mountain in Africa found in the list of wonders of the world. It is not only a unique tourists’ attraction in Tanzania but also a unique world heritage. It was initially very famous for its full snow cover in this warm country, but with the on going climate change, the snow cap on this roof of Africa is slowly, but surely melting and disappearing. This has direct impact to Tanzania and The Voice School’s economy. The country receives 1,000,000 tourists per year who come to see the only point with snow through out the year in Tanzania while We, at The Voice School receive fees from parents who are employed in the tourism industry including those who host Mt Kilimanjaro climbers. If something is not done now, it is very sad that our next generation are likely not to see this only but fast disappearing snow cap in Tanzania.
A very shocking incidence happened in Rombo (at the very foot of Mt Kilimanjaro) on 27th Sept 2021. A number of citizens got fire wounds; got burnt as they were walking in their area. The land/soil was burning hot from deep inside to the surface. They had mixed feelings and thoughts within a frame of commotion and worries. Some thought of volcanic activities that Kilimanjaro was about to erupt. Some thought of presence of natural gas. When the government of Tanzania geological authorities came, they dismissed any signs of volcanic activities. They said due to climatic changes, the increase of temperature is causing the composite inside the land to burn. You can watch this incident on the following link that was sent to me by our school friend and independent online TV owner, Gadi Kitomari (I am sorry it is in Swahili, I believe you can still follow the context).","What are some of the impacts of climate change on Tanzania as described by Daniel Mpanduzi, founder and director of CRED Partner ‘The Voice School Trust’?","The impacts of climate change on Tanzania include poor crop production due to unreliable rains, drought, and unprecedented floods leading to soil infertility, which in turn leads to food insecurity, threats of hunger, and increased poverty levels. The scarcity of water due to increased temperatures is also a major issue, affecting both human and animal consumption, and causing health threats especially in rural areas. The livestock industry is also affected due to the disappearance of water and pasture. Climate change has also led to the invasion of new forms of pests in farms, posing another threat to food security. Lastly, the melting and disappearing snow cap on Mount Kilimanjaro, a major tourist attraction, is impacting the country's economy and the livelihood of those employed in the tourism industry."
350,"Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk predicts his company will sell a ""few million cars"" annually by 2025 — a massive leap over current production — and be profitable by 2020.
The 12-year-old Palo Alto, Calif.-based automaker previously said it hoped to sell 500,000 of its stylish vehicles a year by 2020. Musk, who spoke Tuesday at the Automotive News World Congress in Detroit, has overshot previous volume estimates. And some models have been delayed, including the Model X SUV, originally planned for 2013 but now on track for this summer, he said.
Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas forecast in December that Tesla will sell 297,000 vehicles in 2020; its 2014 sales are estimated at 33,000.
To meet his big volume targets, Tesla will need to expand beyond its factory in Fremont, California Long-term, Musk said, he'd like another Tesla factory in the U.S., plus plants in Europe and Asia, so it doesn't need to ship cars long distances to meet local demand.
Asked if he would consider building a factory in Detroit, Musk didn't rule it out — but took a shot at the legislature.
""Not out of the question — maybe Michigan shouldn't stop us from selling cars. That would be a nice gesture,"" Musk said.
Last year, Gov. Rick Snyder signed legislation banning automakers from selling vehicles directly to customers in Michigan — a move pushed by local auto dealers to block Tesla from selling cars.
General Motors Co. this week unveiled a concept electric vehicle — the Chevrolet Bolt — that it says can go up to 200 miles on a single charge. It would sell for about $37,500 to compete with a planned lower-cost Tesla car. GM North America President Alan Batey dismissed ideas that the Bolt was aimed at Tesla, which sells the Model S for around $100,000, he said. ""They're for the rich and famous, this is for the people,"" Batey said.
Musk told reporters after the World Congress event that he didn't view the Bolt as a ""competitive threat"" to Tesla because he thinks all cars will eventually be electric. He praised GM for moving ahead, but said there were no features in the Bolt or other new EVs that he wanted to emulate.
Tesla's stock fell $15.24 a share in after-hours trading, or 7.5 percent to $189.38, on Musk's comments that sales in China were ""unexpectedly weak in the fourth quarter.""
Musk said that despite the decline in Chinese sales, a perception of charging problems had been reversed and that the company has recently seen an uptick. He said gains in sales in North America and Europe made up for the decline in fourth quarter-sales in China.
The billionaire founder of PayPal and Space X has become the biggest rock star in the auto industry, making huge bets on batteries and vowing a massive increase in sales. He said he is focused on doubling production capacity and beginning work on the lower-cost Model 3, rather than seeking new deals with other carmakers. But he is open to preliminary talks with automakers about long-range projects.
Musk reiterated he will be CEO until at least 2020 when he expects production to hit 500,000 vehicles. He said he will be at Tesla ""as long as I am alive"" but he may not be CEO forever.
The company is now worth about $25 billion. Musk said by the time the lower cost Model 3 is in full production in 2020 it will be profitable. The Model 3, which will be 20 percent smaller than the $100,000 Model S, will cost $35,000 before the federal tax credit — meaning it would be about $2,500 cheaper than the Bolt.
Musk said he is ""absolutely certain"" that Tesla will cut battery costs by 30 percent by 2020, with further cost cuts to follow. Lower cost may make electric cars more attractive to more buyers. In the meantime, their sales across the automotive industry have remained low and face headwinds with sharply lower oil gas prices.
Tesla has poured the foundation on a new $5 billion battery factory in Nevada to make battery cells beginning in 2016 to reduce battery costs. It is a big bet, Musk said, ""but I don't know any other way to do it."" He said Nevada is ""only providing a few hundred million"" for the factory not the $1.5 billion that some have suggested.

Don't you just hate it that men can lose weight faster? My husband is the same way. I think it has to do with men having more muscles than women. But, you both are doing very well. That's excellent progress!
I love my iPhone! I can't imagine not having one. :)
I read something the other day that said women have approximately 10% more body fat than men to start with. Maybe that's why the men get the head start on losing weight. No fair, eh?
Congratulations on the progress that the two of you are making!
Have a great week. :)

I started using just baking soda to brush my teeth 7 years ago. I have Lyme disease and it caused me to became allergic to lots of foods, ingredients, gluten, etc.--including ingredients in all toothpastes I had been using or tried. I truly thank God I was able to use baking soda without a problem.
At the same time, we also started cleaning all windows, glass and mirrors with vinegar and water in a 1/3 vinegar to 2/3 filtered water. Everything shines without the chemicals. We bought some empty squirt bottles, and always have at least one bottle of glass cleaner made up in one of those bottles.
We also use baking soda as a scouring powder to clean kitchen and bathroom sinks, tubs and showers. Even more chemical cleansers and perfumes have been removed from our environment. The baking soda and vinegar are also much cheaper than the items we used before.
We clean all the windows, glass and even eye glasses with my husband's old white t-shirts that have been cut up. They are nice and soft from being worn and washed many times and don't have lint. We cut them to convenient sizes and wash them after use. We keep stacks of these under the bathroom sinks, and convenient places for cleaning eye glasses.
We have a local library that is only a few blocks from us. I used to go all the time, but the Lyme disease has caused me to lose mobility. I hated it a number of years ago when our library threw out all the card catalogs and computerized everything. Now it is a blessing for me. Because everything is computerized, I can request library books, movies, music, etc., on-line, and my dear husband is willing to pick them up for me. We request stuff inter-library loan all the time. One of our family members is at the library at least once a week.
I LOVE entering blog contests, it is so exciting if I win something and get a package in the mail!

2176,"TELLTALE differences of style mark the campaign offices from which Republicans urge Mitt Romney supporters to vote, and those used by Democratic volunteers for President Barack Obama. In the swing state of Virginia the Republican state headquarters fuels its troops on pizza, a television is set to Fox News and volunteers make calls on internet telephone terminals with buttons to record voters’ replies, zapping the information to a central database. The mood is brisk and upbeat. “People are very energised,” says Christine O’Connor, a volunteer.
A few miles away in Fairfax County, a Democratic bastion, the mood is more emotional. A senior White House aide to Mr Obama, Valerie Jarrett, is visiting a field office (in a personal capacity, note staffers). Tucked away in a shopping centre, it is one of more than 60 Obama offices in Virginia—the Republicans have only half as many. Mrs Jarrett offers reassurance, and a sprinkling of Obama stardust. “We really need him, but the world needs him too,” she tells one young man. Hand-painted posters bear such slogans as “Keep VA Blue” and “Sushi 4 Obama”. A sign seeks donations of “healthy snacks”. Calls are made on mobile phones, with data entered into computers later. There is an emphasis on the local. On this particular evening, the focus is on assigning volunteers who will work from “staging locations” in volunteers’ homes in a final four-day push.
Beyond style, a difference of strategy divides the campaigns. A recent tightening of the race involved a surge among Republican-leaning independents, who are more certain to vote and are following the contest more closely than their Democratic equivalents, polls suggest. The Romney ground game involves building on that momentum and widening that intensity gap. In contrast, the Obama plan is about mobilisation, and adding Democratic-leaning voters (Hispanics, blacks and young people) to the pool of those who will actually cast ballots.
A week before election day, some 18m Americans had voted already. Mr Obama has emphasised early voting, allowed in many states, as a way for poorer Democrats to fit voting into busy lives. The president broke with tradition to vote in Chicago on October 25th. The idea was to open the eyes of “sporadic voters” who might not find themselves free to vote on election day, says Mrs Jarrett. In short, Democrats are betting that mobilisation will trump momentum.
Each side offers evidence that its ground game is winning. The Obama camp points to leads among early voters in Iowa or Nevada. They note that in North Carolina, turnout is up among young voters and blacks. A week from election day in vital Ohio, voters from precincts the president won in 2008 had cast 53% of early ballots, while 47% came from precincts that supported Mr McCain. Republicans cite swing states where the percentage of absentee and early voting by Republicans is greater than the percentage of voters who are registered Republican, and where Democrats are below trend, claiming that as a swing.
The Obama camp points to its advantage in field-office numbers: more than 800 nationwide, or more than twice the Republican number. “Buildings don’t make voter contacts,” retorts a Virginia Republican, boasting of gaining 1,000 new volunteers in 48 hours after Mr Romney won the first presidential debate.
Obama party workers say that months of canvassing have left them with finely-crafted lists of likely supporters. An Obama volunteer in Fairfax, Bob Polkinghorn, marvels that the voters on his call lists have already been contacted by the campaign at least once, and sometimes three times. In 2008 Republicans were “clobbered” technologically by Team Obama, concedes a Republican Party boss. This time Republicans are ahead, he says, thanks to clever data-mining and those internet-linked telephones that allow firm supporters to be separated from those who still need revving up. The Virginia party boasts of “Moms for Mitt” phone banks and “Warrior Wednesdays” when ex-servicemen call each other. Both sides claim target-voter lists of equal “efficiency”: the Romney camp reports that 63% of those they contact are supporters, avoiding wasted time and resources. The Obama camp reports 65% efficiency in voter contacts—a measure on which Democrats enjoyed a hefty lead in 2008.
Strip away the competing claims, and early voting data essentially tally with the picture of the race painted by state-by-state polls, says Michael McDonald, an electoral expert at George Mason University. Both parties have become more skilled at mobilising voters in the past decade, in part by returning to tactics familiar to politicians of the 1800s, he adds.

Read our in-depth election briefing
Full coverage of the 2012 presidential election.
In Fairfax Democratic volunteers are duly taught to ask where voters will vote, if they need help getting there, and finally when they might do it. “The very question—when do you plan to vote?—sort of locks them in,” says Mr Polkinghorn.
The problem for Democrats is that a much better turnout operation is not just desirable, but essential. On average, Romney backers are whiter, older, more affluent and have moved around less than the general population: all that fits profiles of those most likely to vote. Democratic hopes rest on numbers: their theoretical voter pool is larger. Both camps sound remarkably convinced that their version of the ground game will triumph. The final count will prove one side right.

JR: My favourite Brahms composition is the Four Serious Songs, one of the last pieces he wrote. They are settings of biblical texts the last of which sets the well-known lines from 1 Corinthians: 'And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.' The way Brahms sets the word 'love' is one of the most amazing outpourings of ecstasy in all music.
PO: What is Andris Nelsons like to work with?
JR: I read that last year Andris Nelsons was the second busiest conductor in the world! I was lucky enough to sing my first Flying Dutchman with him last year, which was a wonderful experience. Like all the greatest conductors, I believe Andris is a true servant of the music - it's not all about him, how he looks or his hairstyle! A humble but exceptionally gifted musician.
PO: Do you enjoy performing with the Philharmonia?
JR: I've been lucky enough to perform quite a few times with the Philharmonia recently. I can honestly say each concert has been a truly memorable experience.

1455,"Dublin | 20 April 2012
The Minister for Children Frances Fitzgerald launched Ireland’s first National Poisons Awareness Day.
Developed by the National Poisons Information Centre at Beaumont Hospital, the day is intended to increase awareness of the dangers of poisons, especially to very young children, of the steps to take to avoid those dangers and what to do if someone has taken something which could be poisonous.
To mark the day the Minister was presented with a storybook, “Say NO to Poisons!”, when she attended Early Childhood Ireland’s conference in Dublin. The book has been developed by the National Poisons Information Centre at Beaumont Hospital with the assistance and support of the staff and children of County Carlow VEC Childcare Centre, the Health Service Executive and Early Childhood Ireland.
The book is one element in a learning and teaching resource being made available to daycare centres and preschools throughout Ireland. It is attractively illustrated by Louise Osborne.
Speaking at the launch NPIC Director Dr. Edel Duggan said that every year the Centre received over 4,000 enquiries concerning young children who had been involved in a poisoning incident.
“Our aim,” she said, “is to educate young children about potential poisons both inside and outside the home, and to help them understand that they should always ask an adult if something is safe to eat or drink.”
Dr Duggan said many people had been involved in developing the new education resource, including Martina Osborne of County Carlow VEC’s Adult and Further Education Office and Nicola Cassidy of the NPIC, who had instigated and driven the project.
As part of its national awareness day NPIC is also keen to ensure that parents and all those with responsibility for looking after children know exactly what to do if they suspect an incident has occurred.
“A quick phone call to our information centre will ensure swift access to the information required. Very often a child will not need to visit a hospital or doctor and we can provide reassurance. But where urgent action is required we can give that information too,” Dr Duggan said. “We would urge everyone to store our number in their phone – 01 809 2166. The line is open from 8 am in the morning to 10 pm at night, seven days a week.”
Fiona McDonnell, HSE Early Years Service said reducing risk of harm from accidental injury was a major area of focus within child health services. The HSE was delighted to support this initiative, she said. “We hope that children, parents and care workers will all benefit from the health education messages provided as part of this programme.
Early Childhood Ireland’s CEO, Irene Gunning, emphasised that young children are naturally curious and could inhale or swallow
poisonous substances without realising the danger. “This can be anything from household detergents to prescribed medicine, which in a child’s mind could be colourful sweets or goodies,” she said.
“The safety of children in our care is top of the agenda for our members and we are happy to do our bit by spreading the word through this story book and by giving the “Say No to Poisons” campaign a platform at our conference. Following simple basic safety rules will help encourage a reduction in the numbers of young children ingesting harmful or poisonous substances, which would be a positive outcome all round.”

While it's possible that this could happen, it almost certainly will not. I see time and time against payday loan companies threaten to have you arrested (which is a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) for a lender to threaten).
They would have to prove criminal intent, and that's very difficult to do in a payday loan situation. The reason is that most individuals that take out a payday loan are already financially strapped, and there's a presumption that they intend to pay again.
They would need to show some additional evidence than you not paying, closing the account, etc... (which is merely a breach, not a crime).
So in short, while it's possible, it's highly highly highly improbable. I've seen many situations of these companies threaten to have you arrested, but I've never seen or heard of a situation where it has actually basically they cannot arrest me?
The company can't.
They could report a ""crime""
But the police probably wouldn't because of lack of evidence of fraudulent intent.

850,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 22 --
NEWS SUMMARY
Team Bush is darn good at the mechanics of modern international presidential travel.
They herd the press corps; they create the photo ops; they manage the take-aways; they answer the questions the way they want them answered; they trot out smooth-as-butta Dan Bartlett; and they don't let the storyline get away from them.
No less an Owl Eyes than CBS News Mark Knoller used the phrase ""tres bien"" with his flawless French accent!) on the radio this morning pertaining to thawing Franco-American relations, although he might as well have been speaking about the whole trip so far.
And/but back here at home (as they say in the news dodge when they are trying to be transitional), the big game remains the President's Social Security overhaul vision.
The Gang of 500 (and/including Republican members of the Congress) continue to propagate the CW that what constituents say to members during the current Capitol Hill recess (and what members are able to convince constituents to believe) will go a long way toward determining the fate of the reform effort.
In fact, you don't need to get all that into the weeds of the tea leaves to say that many ""observers"" (read: ""participants"") see the first threshold as whether anything should be tried AT ALL -- and that comes before the questions of WHAT should be tried for and IF something can be passed in 2005.
Stories from two of the leading political reporters on the 2004 presidential campaign tell the tale:
The New York Times' Jodi Wilgoren writes about ""folding before the flop . . . "" LINK
And Pat Healy (formerly of the Boston Globe but now also of the Times), wrote yesterday about a ""melancholy spell over the city."" LINK
Now, Wilgoren was writing about poker and Healy about TV shows set in New York, but you get our gist.
Perhaps more on point: the Wall Street Journal today writes about intra-GOP divisions over taxes; personal-account-booster Rep. Paul Ryan doesn't seem all that optimistic; and Ways and Means point guy Rep. McCrery reveals a ""Sopranos""-style sit-down with some Administration officials after he recently uttered a discouraging word -- and then closes his New York Times profile with some MORE discouraging words. (More on all this below.)
So while the President -- pre-departure -- cast the Social Security mission as convincing people that there IS a problem, we see the bigger issue right now as convincing Republicans that, in the end, Social Security reform is going to happen. Because without that, the heavy lift becomes excessively Sisyphean.
As both Peter Pan and Tug McGraw have said: You gotta believe.
The Believer-in-Chief -- surely monitoring all these developments from overseas -- has a European day that is packed.
By the time you read this, he has breakfasted with Blair; bi-lated with Berlusconi and met with Yushenko. At 10:45 am ET, he attends an EU meeting. He takes a class photo with EU leaders at 12:20 pm ET. Just before 1:00 pm ET, he takes questions at a news conference with EU leaders.
He has another bi-lat with the EU Commission President at 1:30 pm ET, a working dinner with the EU council and commission at 2:15 pm ET, and then RONS in Brussels.
Congress, of course, is on recess (but happy birthday, Sen. Frist!). The Supreme Court meets at 10:00 am ET for arguments without Chief Justice William Rehnquist. Today, the justices will hear the Kelo v. New London eminent domain case.
How:",What is the main focus of President Bush's team during his international travel?,"The main focus of President Bush's team during his international travel is managing the mechanics of the travel. They herd the press corps, create photo ops, manage the take-aways, answer questions the way they want them answered, and ensure the storyline doesn't get away from them."

8,"Most of us have had moments when we think we are fairly unique; the main character of life’s story if you will. I was having one of these moments on Friday night when I approached the TIFF Bell Lightbox in Toronto for a screening of Hitchcock’s classic Dial M for Murder. Surely I would be one of only a handful of cinephiles out on Friday night to catch a movie that is over 50 years old. This attitude was largely responsible for the shock I experienced when I had to scramble to find a seat. The screening must of have been sold out! Perhaps more surprising to me was the variety of people in the audience. Couples were on dates, a mother and her two teenage daughters laughed and gabbed as they found some front row seats, small packs of university students congregated at the back, and an elderly woman asked me to save her a seat in case her expedition towards the centre of the row proved fruitless. The audience was devoid of pretension and snobbery, these people were here to be entertained, and I realized, as I shed my own pretensions, so was I.
I should mention that the TIFF Bell Lightbox is an amazing movie theatre. The seats are spacious and comfortable, while the cup-holders are ingenious, as they are in front of and below the armrest and completely out of the way, while still easily accessible. Also, the four screenings that I have seen have started promptly, without commercials or previews; kind of a nice change of pace considering that previews are easily accessible online these days.
Dial M for Murder went off without a Hitch, if you don’t count its director. Grace Kelly was still beautiful as the delicate Margot Wendice, Ray Milland has retained his charismatically cloaked deviousness as Tony Wendice, who is in the market for a murdered wife, and my second time watching the film has given me a huge appreciation for the very humorous performance by John Williams as the infallible Chief Inspector Hubbard.
The strengths of Dial M for the Murder, and the reasons why it is a classic, are the strong performances by the cast, the intelligent screenplay from Frederick Knott (based on his play of the same name), and of course, the Master of Suspense behind the camera. Rarely do plays adapted for the screen work as well as this one. The quality of Dial M for Murder is in the same league as Sleuth (1972), which is high praise from me considering Sleuth is by far my favourite film of all-time.
I have trouble expressing how wonderful and fortunate Torontonians are to have a theatre like the Lightbox that is willing to screen Hitchcock classics, on actual film no less. If you grew up with Hitchcock films and want to feel nostalgic, or if you’re younger and are feeling adventurous, I urge you to get down to the Lightbox in November or December as there are some amazing Hitchock screenings ahead of us. Let the Master of Suspense show you how the old-school use to do it, before the Hollywood thriller became formulaic. Do not miss this opportunity!

1293,"Are You Selling Your People Short?
Change the way you view employees' talents, and you'll better appreciate their value
Does your organization focus too intensely on employees' weaknesses -- or worse, use belittling terms to speak about their strengths?
In the corporate world, managers routinely subject employees to performance reviews that emphasize their ""areas for improvement,"" not their talents. The problem with this approach is that by focusing on weaknesses, organizations fail to capitalize on their employees' strengths.
To inspire exceptional performance, organizations must reverse this lens so they can better see, understand, and more effectively deploy every individual's innate drives and abilities. This means focusing on each employee's natural and unique ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving: his or her talents.
When organizations begin to emphasize talents -- and adopt a positive language to identify them, such as the 34 talent themes measured by the Clifton StrengthsFinder -- they transform conversations, relationships, and most importantly, performance, all for the better. Rather than denigrating a hard-charging employee by labeling her as ""impatient,"" we can understand that she has powerful talents in the Activator theme. Instead of mocking Juan as a ""schmoozer"" or a ""phony,"" we can recognize his talents in Winning Others Over (the Woo theme). Is Sally ""bossy""? Or does she simply possess exceptional Command talents?
Terms such as ""impatient,"" ""phony,"" or ""bossy"" are what we'd call ""barrier labels."" They are barriers to understanding -- and to developing and celebrating -- what people naturally do best. Juan's Woo talents or Sally's Command may be untapped assets for your company. Juan very well could be your next sales star, and Sally might be management material. But are barrier labels preventing you from seeing and tapping their potential?
Try to understand barrier labels through your own experience. Jot down one of your top talent themes, or write down words or phrases that others sometimes use to compliment you, such as ""He's so inspiring"" or ""She's a great source of information."" Now, think about barrier labels that people have used to give a negative connotation to the same qualities, such as ""He has his head in the clouds"" or ""She's such a bookworm."" You'll probably find that many of your greatest talents are often negatively labeled -- and those labels don't help you make the most of your talents, do they?
The ""workaholic""
Jerry, a participant in a recent strengths development program for salespeople, is a very talented Achiever. But he explained that he was also burdened with a barrier label: ""workaholic."" Indeed, Jerry said that even his wife, Anne, often used that negative term to describe him, especially when she felt that he wasn't spending enough time with her or their two children.
With this label in place, the only solution either of them could imagine was for Jerry to spend less time at work, which can be very difficult for an Achiever. For Jerry, less time in the office would mean fewer opportunities to accomplish things. That would make him miserable, and eventually, he would go back to working long hours. But that would, in turn, make his family miserable. Obviously, this solution was no solution.
At home after the workshop, Jerry sat down with Anne to talk about this problem. As Jerry described how his Achiever talents naturally make him think, feel, and behave, Anne experienced a revelation: Jerry's Achiever talents represent not only an exceptional ability to achieve, but also a need to achieve. He is internally driven to do more and accomplish more, and he invariably feels fulfilled by those achievements. Jerry's talents are an undeniable part of him. They cannot be ""turned off""; they pull him toward opportunities to achieve.
Enlightened by this discovery, Jerry and Anne forged a plan. Jerry would now look for opportunities to achieve at home. How? For starters, two nights a week, he would help get the kids bathed and ready for bed -- no small achievement. And each week, the couple would make a list of at least three family activities for the weekend, such as bike rides or trips to the grocery store. Jerry's assignment was to make these activities happen. This arrangement was perfect for him; checking off the items on his family's ""to do"" list gave him a real sense of achievement as a father and a husband.
Jerry has applied an additional tactic. By starting his day an hour earlier and answering crucial e-mails before the family gets up, many mornings he can have breakfast with them. And now that Anne sees Jerry's Achiever talents as an asset, she is much more understanding and flexible and more interested in Jerry's work. She no longer sees him as a ""workaholic."" Instead, she sees him as an Achiever -- both at home and at work.
It's no coincidence that Jerry reports being more productive and engaged at work. With the balance between home and work restored, he now sees a long-term future with his company, and he no longer feels pangs of guilt when he has to work extra-long days.
The ""gossip""
Claire is another example. During a management program, she realized she had been dealing with a barrier label. Claire's manager, Sue, had long ago labeled her the ""group gossip."" It was a running joke at the office, and Claire had fun with it as well. Then the group took the Clifton StrengthsFinder and discovered each of their top five talent themes. For Claire, Communication is number one.
When Sue learned about Claire's top theme, she said, ""Now I understand why you are always talking with others -- and more importantly, I see how I can use that to help all of us stay connected."" After their discussion, Sue started briefing Claire every Monday on key messages that needed to be shared with the group. Both Claire and Sue love this arrangement, and the team is more informed than ever.
Looking beyond barrier labels allows managers to tap a vast amount of underused potential in their employees. So the next time you place a barrier label on an employee -- or on yourself -- ask yourself a couple of important questions: ""What is really driving that behavior?"" and ""How could that behavior be used in a positive way?"" That is the first step to inspiring greater performance.",What is the problem with focusing on employees' weaknesses during performance reviews?,The problem with focusing on weaknesses during performance reviews is that organizations fail to capitalize on their employees' strengths.
2206,"School choice proponents gather in Frankfort
Supporters of school choice issues have held rallies and events in Frankfort before, but Friday's rally felt different, attendees said.
Many longtime proponents feel like this will be their year, now that Republicans hold both legislative chambers and the governor’s office.
""It will be exciting to see something, because it's been talked about for some time, and I would just like to see some change somewhere,"" said Jeff Chaplin, a parent who supports tax credits or vouchers for private school tuition.
Vouchers might not be on tap yet, but bills likely to pass include charter school legislation and a bill providing a tax credit for donations to scholarships that help low- to middle-income students attend private schools.
The latter idea was the focus of the rally, which included speeches by two bill sponsors in the House and Senate.
""We need to get politics out of the way,"" said one of those sponsors, Rep. Bam Carney, R-Campbellsville. ""We need to get race out of the way. We need to get economic status out of the way and do what's best by the child, and I'm convinced my 138 colleagues in Frankfort will make those measures happen and happen soon.""
The rally was held outside the Capitol building and sponsored by the National School Choice Coalition and EdChoice Kentucky. Despite cold temperatures and snow flurries, it drew a healthy crowd of least a couple hundred people.
""I think everybody should have a choice to get the education that fits their needs, and the public schools around my area aren't fitting to my children's needs,"" said parent Paige Hunt.
Critics point to states where charter schools have proven no more effective than traditional public schools, and worry they will only siphon resources from the public school system.
Carney, a former public school social studies teacher now who now works in public schools administration, acknowledged those concerns.
""Well, I think the first thing, to do it correctly, is to be cautious,"" he said. ""The good thing is we've got 43 other models to look at, some have worked well, and some have not worked well. We've been trying to study those. So for many members this year, in the General Assembly, in both parties, there still is a lot of debate on what is the best approach.""
The 2017 General Assembly is in recess. It's scheduled to resume on Feb. 7.",What were the main issues discussed at the school choice rally in Frankfort?,"The main issues discussed at the school choice rally in Frankfort were charter school legislation, a bill providing a tax credit for donations to scholarships that help low- to middle-income students attend private schools, and the need to remove politics, race, and economic status from education decisions."

We guarantee our Vanuatu Kava powder is 100% pure Vanuatu kava roots and contains no leaves or stems. Vanuatu Kava is considered the best quality and most potent Kava in the world.

We also have unmatched customer service and ship your order same day if received before 2:30 p.m. PST.
What does Kava taste like? Kava is definitely an acquired taste. Kava tea/juice has a bitter, peppery taste. However, adding a juice of a 1/2 Lemon or Lime or some honey or coconut milk/water and/or bringing the temperature down by adding a few ice cubes makes it more palatable. There are many delicious Kava drink recipes - See our recipe page.
After a couple of cups your mouth will tingle and feel numb - this is a symptom of the narcotic effect on your body. You will feel its effects in minutes and all effects within 20 minutes.
What is Kava? Kava is a tropical evergreen shrub with large heart-shaped leaves and woody stems that grows naturally in Pacific Polynesia. Its thick roots are mashed or ground and then made into tea/juice by adding water and squeezing and filtering the kava pulp using cloth as a filter. A member of the black pepper family, kava's active properties are the kavalactones found in its roots. When consumed, kava relaxes the body and mind while maintaining mental alertness and focus. For many centuries, the pacific islanders have regarded kava with much respect for its spiritual and medicinal effects. Drinking kava promotes a mellow euphoric experience while the mind stays clear and content. Many drink kava to promote better sleep with no ""hang over"" effect and waking the next day with a refreshed feeling. Kava is also amazing for treating ailments like migraine headaches and cramps. Kava is also a positive natural alternative to drugs and alcohol. It has a long history of ritual and recreational use in Pacific Polynesia and is now a common herbal product used to reduce anxiety and stress, insomnia, and improve one's mood.
Who Should Not Drink Kava and what is the Recommended Daily Dosage? Kava should not be consumed by persons under the age of 18, or if pregnant, nursing or taking prescription drugs. Do not exceed recommended dose (32 oz. of kava tea per day or 1500 mill.
Is Kava Safe for my Liver? This is another often asked question we get from customers. It is important to note that reports of liver damage have been proven false.
Most of you have probably seen or heard about the FDA Kava warnings. Please note that there has never been any cases liver disease associated with the traditional use of Kava. Humans have been using Kava as a relaxing beverage for 3,000 years. In the South Pacific Island nations of Vanuatu, Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga kava drinking is a daily practice for hundreds of thousands of people. There has never been a pattern of liver disease connected to the drinking of kava in these countries. The natives of South Pacific do not have liver problems and they have been drinking Kava for thousands of years.
All our Kava products only contain the root of the Kava plant, which contain no harmful compounds.
Years ago, several reports had come out of individuals who were taking Kava experiencing liver failure. To err on the side of caution, Kava reported cases of liver failure.

Completely Disappointed
I started homeschooling my 5th grader after the Thanksgivng break. I've come to realize that he is so far behind!! It's like the schools just passed him along. His grades never even got bad until the 5th grade. His behavior was getting worse and his grades were dropping, so I did what I felt was right.. and thank goodness I did! His math is barely at a 3rd grade level! He's 12 years old.. already a lot older than other 5th graders due to his birthday being late in the year and he was held back in kindergarten because off not being at the proper maturity levels. I need help. I'm so worried about his future. How do I get him on the fastrack to being where a 12 year old should be? I've dropped his Math, Science, and Social Studies to a 4th grade level... he does very well in 5th grade Language Arts & Extentions. I'm sick with worry...
Here's some good news: middle school can be used as a time of ""catching up"".
Most children have already learned to read, write a paragraph, and do the four basic math functions by then. If yours hasn't, he has plenty of time before high school to catch up.
Don't be in a huge hurry. That will put too much pressure on both of you. If he's at a third grade level in math, let him do the third grade level, at a normal pace. Next year, he might be a sixth grader doing fourth grade math. The following year, as a seventh grader, he might be doing fifth grade math, and he'll complete sixth grade math (which is challenging for many adults) as an eighth grader. That will prepare him to take a basic math class as a freshman (for kids who find math challenging) and leave three high school years to fit in some algebra or geometry. He'll be fine.
This is from a homeschooling mom whose kids are math challenged: We took the slow-and-steady route and three of them have graduated from our homeschool and have done just fine in college algebra.
It's good that you have him home, so you can provide some one-on-one tutoring and allow him to proceed at his own rate, without feeling he's a failure. Of course, this all assumes that math is actually challenging for him. If he's being lazy, that's another matter.
Thanks OP for asking this question and thank you, Kelly for the great answer!! I know it has put some of my fears to rest!!
Yes Great answer Kelly!!
I agree try not to worry to much and force him to work a grade level he is not ready for. It is better to take him back a few grades and let him learn the work correctly.
If you want him to catch up faster you could school year round. We personally school year round and really like the freedom of taking breaks when we want to and this allows the kids to work more at thier own pace .
Please keep us updated about how he is doingRoadschooling Mom to DD & DS
This is what happened to my son/sons when we pulled them from 6th and 5th grades. We already knew my older son was behind in Math, its his worst subject but we didnt realize HOW behind he was. I was very sad and angry for him. T4L really made a difference with him. We pulled him from 6th grade in Oct. and by June he was finishing and understanding Math for his grade level! It still isnt his best subject and we are kinda at a road block with it right now BUT..... I feel that pulling him was the best thing we did!
HUGS and Happy Homeschooling to you!

2110,"His latest book False Profits, Recovering from the Bubble Economy, is an attempt to give a straightforward account of the worst financial crisis in 70 years and stem what he sees as moves to rewrite history by the folk who got it all wrong.
Any narrative of the crisis that strays into collateralised debt obligations or structured investment vehicles is part of a plot to absolve the incompetent from blame, he argues.
By his telling, the unravelling of the American economy was inevitable — a simple consequence of the collapse of an $8 trillion housing bubble that had been inflated by politicians and the Federal Reserve. Fans of Alan Greenspan, if there are any left, will wince.
Baker — a co-director of the Centre for Economic and Policy Research — cannot be dismissed as being wise after the event: he was banging on about this bubble since at least 2002. Indeed, identifying that the American housing market was overvalued was a matter, he says, of ""third-grade arithmetic"".
For 100 years, from 1895 to 1995, American house prices tracked inflation. On average, houses rose in value at the same rate as food, cars and clothes. A trend that lasts so long and manages to survive world wars and the Great Depression should be taken seriously. Any deviation from it would need to be explained.
Between 1995 and 2002, houses prices outpaced inflation by 30% — already a $3 trillion bubble.
""Absolutely nothing on either the demand or the supply side of the market could have explained this unprecedented increase,"" he writes.
The rental market, he notes, continued to rise in line with inflation and so there was no reason to see the surge in house prices as anything other than an unsustainable bubble — just another internet-style boom which was bound to go pop.
At that point, regulators such as the Federal Reserve should have highlighted the evidence that was staring it in the face and clamped down on bad loans from the banks. The banks themselves in turn should have been more cautious. What should be done to prevent the same thing happening again?
Baker says: sack everyone in a position of authority who couldn't see it coming to give the next lot the incentive to get it right. America's financial system, he reckons, doesn't need new regulations just new regulators.
""Washington is chock-full of people working on economic policy in positions at the Treasury, the Fed and various regulatory agencies and elsewhere who earn six-figure salaries.
""They all failed to see or issue warnings about the housing bubble. Not one of these has gotten fired. In fact, not a single person involved in economic policy has probably even missed a promotion because of this gross failing,"" he writes. Baker doesn't get invited to cocktails in the capital much. It's a refreshing approach.

Too much or too little? Either way, Blankfein's pay defies logic
""There's speculation and there's stupidity. This speculation transcends the simply stupid and takes it to a new level.""
That's Goldman Sachs' usually charming spokesman Lucas Van Praag dismissing a newspaper report suggesting that the bank is poised to pay chief executive Lloyd Blankfein $100 million for his efforts in the past year.
The story, we are told, is ""rather bizarre"", ""nonsense"" and ""fictional"".
The thing is, were it not for the pressure the bank is under to look ""responsible"" on the issue of executive pay, and the embarrassment the top brass seem to feel about their own rewards (what took them so long?), that's roughly what Blankfein would be getting.
After all, he got $68 million in 2007, a year when the bank didn't do anything like as well as it has just done.
So if it isn't giving Blankfein more than that, Goldman is underpaying him this year.
This presumably means, given the bank's usual justification for its pay structure, that he is now highly likely to quit in search of higher rewards elsewhere.
Alternatively, the $68 million he got three years ago was completely absurd, and he should give most of it back. Which is it?
Lloyds must hurry for benefits of St James's sell-off
Expect news from St James's Place sooner rather than later.
The insurer and wealth manager is 60%-owned by Lloyds Banking Group, a stake it acquired as part of the ill-fated HBOS deal last year.
All agree that in the long term this is an anomaly which needs to be ironed out — a bank owned by the taxpayer shouldn't really hold stakes in the likes of SJP — but the public stance is that there is no rush.
In theory both sides are perfectly happy with the status quo for the time being: St James's Place chief executive David Bellamy says he would prefer to see the stake placed in the market rather than sold to a larger group that might try to interfere in a highly successful operation but he's comfortable letting Lloyds go at its own pace.
And Eric Daniels, chief executive at Lloyds, has bigger fish to fry — so why worry about this?
One good reason to expect action is that the new Euro-imposed banking rules — laws and regulations issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, also known as Basel II — come into place in 2012.
At the moment, banks get full credit for the embedded value of any insurer they happen to own, boosting their balance sheets.
But as soon as Basel II kicks in, they only get half credit. That means around £400 million of capital will disappear — not a huge amount for a business the size of Lloyds but enough to affect the banks' tier-one capital ratio. The point is that St James's Place is presently on the up — fourth-quarter sales figures were excellent, ""stunning"", even, according to one analyst.
So right now Lloyds could probably sell its stake at a premium to embedded value, an opportunity that may not exist for long.
That's why you can assume that talks are underway at some level.
The quicker Lloyds does a deal the better.

149,"Mental Health Front & Centre (Canberra Doctor - September 2017)
Mental Health Front and Centre
AMA (ACT) President, Prof Steve Robson and ACT Chair of the Royal Australia and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, A/Prof Jeff Looi, have met with Mental Health Minister, Shane Rattenbury, to lay out their shared concerns about the state of the psychiatry workforce and other mental health issues in the ACT.
The meeting was both cordial and constructive, with the Minister listening carefully to the issues raised and demonstrating a willingness to engage. While mental health is a new portfolio brought into existence after the last ACT election at the initiative of the ACT Greens, several other Australian jurisdictions have established specific mental health portfolio responsibilities.
Psychiatric Workforce
The major issue raised with the Minister was both the immediate and medium term future of the psychiatric workforce in the ACT.
AMA (ACT) believes there are ongoing and serious difficulties in the ACT’s public sector psychiatric workforce. The situation is currently being held together by the use of locums and the considerable goodwill and dedication of local consultants and psychiatric trainees, together with mental health service management.
Away from the immediate crisis, the use of ‘Area of Need’ appointments and locums continues to be the primary means of dealing with the shorter and medium term issues in public sector psychiatric staff recruitment – a situation AMA (ACT) would like to see rectified.
The private sector workforce, while not in a similar short-term crisis, is still deficient in consultant psychiatrists and particularly so when it comes to the child and adolescent subspecialty. As discussed with the Minister, the lack of local private sector workforce is puzzling given the many attractive features working in Canberra provides to medical practitioners.
Workforce Plan Needed
While there seems to be little alternative to the public sector’s use of Area of Need appointments and locums in the short term, AMA (ACT) believes it should be an urgent priority to draft a comprehensive workforce plan for the combined ACT public and private sector psychiatric workforce, both specialist and trainee. The workforce plan should emphasise recruitment and retention and specifically consider safety, working conditions and incentives to work and remain in the ACT.
It would make sense, given similar work previously undertaken by the RANZCP for the Victorian Government, if the College was involved in the ACT workforce plan, at least in relation to the public sector workforce.
Mental Health Advisory Council
AMA (ACT) and the RANZCP both expressed concern over the lack of either a psychiatrist or GP on the Council. The Minister responded by stating that he recognized the need for suitable input to the Council from medical practitioners.
Further discussions with the Minister are to be held in order to determine how it is – whether through co-opting or other means – input from medical practitioners can be made available to the Council.
Office of Mental Health
The Minister has recently released a ‘conversation starter’ that seeks the views of stakeholders on the role and function of the new Office of Mental Health. The ‘conversation starter’ is designed to seek the views of stakeholders on the role and function of the new Officer of Mental Health.

1081,"There are many, many logical and sound reasons to conclude that what we call “hero ball” is a terrible way to try to win basketball games. Speaking statistically, paying attention to the ins and outs of advanced metrics, a player working in isolation in the clutch is at best a shakey proposition. At worst, it not only loses the game, but pisses off teammates. And yet it happens all the damn time.
Take the game this past Easter Sunday between the Knicks and the Bulls. Once the Knicks blew their gargantuan lead, they found themselves down three with thirty seconds to play. And they drew up a beauty of a play that you can read all about here, but for now, just watch it:
Just look at that: solid screens, fake action, Melo being generous with the rock, an unexpected player getting a wide open look. And the shot doesn’t go in.
By way of contrast, let’s watch Carmelo Anthony’s game winner in overtime:
This is by any definition hero ball. Just a spot up three-pointer by the team’s best player and it won them the game. This was, by the way, after an earlier Anthony three that was just as flagrantly heroic tied the game to send it to overtime.
And we loved every single minute of it. Anybody who’s ever argued for the sanity and reason of running well-designed plays should admit that they were as floored by this as any casual fan who still judges players by their rings. We loved it because we’re more Kirk than Spock, more Han Solo than C3PO. We don’t want to know the chance of successfully navigating the asteroid field is is approximately three thousand, seven hundred twenty to one. We don’t want to hear that the odds of getting out of here are approximately seven thousand eight hundred twenty four point seven to one. When the game is on the line, we don’t want a fancy plan. We want:
And I’m not citing those pop culture examples just for fun. See, our stories teach us to go against the odds. They tell us that against all reason, one hero must emerge from the rabble and lead the good guys to victory against every expectation we have for failure. When people say they want the ball in Kobe’s hands with the clock winding down, it’s not even really because they think he has a better chance of hitting that last shot than another player. It’s because the story demands that he take and make that last shot.
None of this is to say that attempting to make mathematical sense of the game or indeed that any attempt to bring more reason and clarity to the game is ill-advised. The game needs to evolve, to become something new in response to new ideas. But isn’t its wild ridiculousness what lies at the core of our love for it? Isn’t this ultimately why sports are so great in the first place? Truly great games like the Knicks-Bulls tilt this past Sunday stand on the border between the real world and fiction. The stories inside them lash out at the rules that give the game structure, at the probabilities and plans and diagrams. Hero ball doesn’t make statistical sense, but it makes narrative sense for people who grew up on stories of heroes overcoming fantastic odds. Can it demonstrably be shown to hurt your team’s chance to win? Absolutely, but one need look no further than the trials of LeBron James to see that there are a lot of people who would rather see him lose with the ball in his hands than make the smart play.
Basketball is not just a sport, not just a reflection of percentages and points and metrics. It’s a reflection of our culture, of both its best and worst aspects. Every buzzer-beating three affirms it in our blood: we might take a Steve Novak jumper home to mom and dad, but we want to stay out all night and party with a Carmelo Anthony iso.",What is the term used to describe a player working in isolation in the clutch in basketball games?,"The term used to describe a player working in isolation in the clutch in basketball games is ""hero ball""."

291," speaking of the soul. The only part of the computer that can speak directly to a human being without hiding what it is.
Have you read Neal Stephenson’s paean, In the Beginning was the Command Line? If not, I recommend the digression. It’s a long way ’round to the same thing I am saying here, but a better one all the same.
The computer programmers reading this mostly understand already. But this isn’t for them, I preach not to the choir. Let me tell you a secret you could never learn at Hogwarts: should a muggle learn the command line, the muggle becomes a wizard. It is true. Full command of your computer is yours, anyone’s. But it comes at a price…
The cost isn’t money. And the only pounds of flesh are the ones you will add sitting in front of a computer screen. No, the price is time. You cannot become proficient at the command line overnight. Yet you can get started easily with little fuss.
Try it now! If you are on a Microsoft Windows machine, look for ‘Command Prompt’. PowerShell is the real wizard’s tool here, but not required. If you are on an Apple Macintosh, look for ‘Terminal’. If you are on Linux . . . never mind, if you are on Linux you already know what to do.
Now, there you are. Go ahead. Use it. What are you waiting for?
OK, I lied. There is a great deal of fuss involved. Using a command line is a pain in the ass. It gives you no help at all, although some command lines allow you to type ‘help’ and get some kind of semi-useful response. On a command line you are left alone in a digital wilderness without a map or a compass. Even experts spend a lot of time searching the web for clues and reading documentation to discover which command they should use or configuration file they should tweak to some particular end. Or, more likely, what they are doing wrong in their commanding and tweaking because it seems like there is no end in sight. By their nature command lines are damn hard to use; this is why we invented Graphical User Interfaces, even if they really are rather useless in furthering a human’s dialogue with the computer. At least they let a regular person get basic tasks done.
Of course there are those working on Artificial Intelligence designed to create an actual dialogue. Making it so you simply discuss your need with the computer until you arrive at a solution together. But, in truth, this is a long way off; and even if we manage to make a conversation between a human and a computer more clear than that between two random humans it will still fall short of the ideal.
Why? Because we will be making the computer talk like a human and understand like a human. It doesn’t give you the wizardly power over the computer a command line can give you; it simply means you will be arguing with your computer because it did what you said and not what you meant.
There is no such confusion on the command line. There you speak directly to the soul of the machine and it does exactly what you say. You can get it wrong, certainly, but it’s always you getting it wrong. Not the computer. You. Yet get it right and your computer will always do exactly what you want. The only problem is that time thing I mentioned. Only someone obsessed with computers would spend the time and effort and directionless anger required to master the command line. People like me.
Here’s where I admit I lied again. I really am talking to computer programmers, my sisters and brothers in code. Those who know of what I speak because they too have screamed in frustration when something that ought to work just isn’t working. Over and over, not working no matter what we try. Pounded the desk because we searched and found hundreds of people complaining about exactly the same problem, but no one posting a useful explanation of why. Maybe you find some cryptic incantation that fixes or at least changes your problem, but you don’t know why. And not knowing why means you haven’t gained the conceptual framework required to avoid other classes of the same problem. It means you haven’t gained a better understanding of the computer’s soul.
There are lots of things we could do to fix the command line, yet we do not do them. We could add a basic ‘help’ command everywhere; a command that when entered without an argument or option assumes you are lost and need a map. We could write better documentation and we could make it easier to find. We could even come up with a lingua-franca of commands sharing similar arguments and options so we don’t have the extra cognitive load of knowing the meaning of ‘–foo’ is always entirely different depending on context. We could do many things to improve the command line experience, but it won’t be enough.
Not until we add one more option. Like ‘–help’ (or ‘-h’ or ‘-?’) this option has the same meaning for every single command. But this option doesn’t describe a command or sub-commands or arguments or options. No, it does something different–it tells you why.
And that is why I’m begging those creating or maintaining command line software to add this new option: we need ‘-e’ or ‘–explain’.

- Be easy on yourself - There is a lot going on at the conference: programs, events, discussions, vendors, placement services, etc. I wanted to do everything, but by the end of the first day I wanted to have a primal scream session and collapse. The next day, I mentioned how overwhelmed I felt to a woman who helped run the placement services and she assured me that this was normal and that you really have to pick and choose only a few things to do each day; if you're planning on looking for a job at the placement services, plan on spending a good chunk of your time there. Also, remembering to make time to eat is a good idea.
- Social events are great for networking - Sunday night I went to the New Members Round Table Social where I not only made new friends who are also recent grads looking for jobs, but I also met the State Librarian of California, the president of PLA, and the president of the Boston Public Library. The new president of ALA was also there, but I didn't get a chance to say hi. I also made a fool of myself on the dance floor, which probably negated any possibility that any of these people will take me seriously in the future. I have to say though, that you really haven't lived until you've seen hundreds of librarians trying to dance.
- The conference paradox - Although as a ""newbie,"" the conference was quite overwhelming, it was empowering as well. There is something about being around tens of thousands of members of your profession that can make you feel pretty good about your career choice.

After I wrote my last blog, I went to the Library of Congress for a special after hours event they had for ALA attendees. This was quite the experience. Basically, they let us roam around the main reading room and some of the librarians who work there told us about the history of the room. We even got to go below the central desk for a peek at the inner workings of the library and the stacks that are off limits to the public. All the attendee librarians were like kids in a candy store.
Then I attended the premiere of Hollywood Librarian, a documentary about librarians and how they have been stereotyped through film. This was an excellent film that was at times funny and heartbreaking. You can see the trailer on youtube if you search the title. The writer/director is asking that libraries show it to their patrons (for a fee) during Banned Books Week.
This experience is pretty overwhelming on many different levels. There is so much going on and I want to see everything and meet everyone, but I'm trying to take it easy on myself and pick and choose events carefully. Also, as a very new MLIS graduate, with my future as a librarian still in front of me, it is a little daunting to face all this information at once.

When you register as a first-time attendee, they give you a bright yellow ribbon to let everybody know that you are a newbie (the ribbon cleverly has the word ""new"" spelt out with a picture of a bumble bee next to it). Its like those signs they have on student driver cars that say, ""look out, this person has no idea what they are doing, and they might hurt you or themselves.""

- How to get money for your org
- Fundraising
- What type of events & workshops are popular
- How to set up a general email account
- How to set up your own listserv
- Where to get your stuff archived and saved for future student leaders
- Contact names (both from WSU and from our respective organizations)
- Working with Student Council (read, getting MORE money)
- Important annual events (orientations, open houses, etc)
- How to get involved off-campus
- Writing an annual report
- Becoming an ""official"" group on campus (Dean of Students Office)

Beverly Farms, MA – The North of Boston Arts Center (NOBAC) will be hosting their first open house on September 2 from 5-7 pm at the Hastings House in Beverly Farms. This event will be held in conjunction with Hastings House members and will give parents, families and prospective members a chance to meet with the NOBAC and Hastings House staff and board. Attendees can also learn about this Fall’s schedule of art, music, theater and cooking classes; tour the Hastings House facilities; and enjoy refreshments as they mingle.
NOBAC after school arts classes are available at the Hastings House on Monday-Thursday from 4-6 pm for children ages 5-13, beginning September 7th. In addition to the after school arts program, NOBAC also puts on two musical productions every year in the Spring and the Fall. This Fall’s production is The Tale of the Oysta: a seafaring Whoops, which was written entirely by students in Henry Allen’s Playwrights Unite! class this summer, is based on about 20 songs by Cole Porter and George & Ira Gershwin.
This young nonprofit was founded in May of 2008 by Beverly local, Bonnie Rynkowski, with the hopes of giving children a creative outlet and direction in any area of interest – from visual arts and crafts to jazz, opera and organic cooking.
Over the last year, NOBAC has seen a considerable amount of growth with the addition of Manchester-By-The-Sea resident Henry Allen, its artistic director who has directed the shows that NOBAC students perform in the Spring and Fall, and is a member of the core faculty.
Faculty member and local business owner, Jessica Brand, is excited about the growth she has seen at NOBAC over the last year:
“I remember this time last year when we had two or three kids in each class and only a handful of parents getting involved. This year we have seen so many families really get excited about NOBAC and the invaluable experience we’re providing for their kids. We hope that this open house will only help us expand our community and open up more opportunities for us to reach out to local kids who are interested in the arts.”
The Hastings House is located in Beverly Farms across from the Train Station at 14 Oak Street.

Hi.
Ok, Help me out here!
WTF IS THIS!
Is it a Tall Rat? A Fisher Cat? Or just a poor Ferrat let go by its irresponsible owner?
Photos taken at the State Fish Pier.
I’ve had lens lust for a while now for the Nikon AF Micro Nikkor 60mm f/2.8. I couldn’t justify paying $500 for it, so I checked out the auctions on Ebay and found several of these lenses. I watched the bidding, and they seemed to go for around $275. I knew that my limit was $250. After getting outbid on four auctions, I persevered and won last night for $236.50! Happy girl!!!!

This is one of the top three weekends to visit Gloucester IMO. We usually have clear dry weather and the schooners are just gorgeous to go aboard. If you haven’t already got tickets to go aboard the Thomas Lannon I’d call Kay in the office ADSAP and make arrangements. Captain Tom will show you a great time and tell you all about the Schooners in port as you glide around Gloucester Harbor. Check out The Thomas Lannon Website here for details on how to get tickets for a cruise.

So when Krush asked if they could shoot the 2011 calendar down at the dock I told her I think it would be a perfect fit.

339,"Now.
This is a nice windfall for the state but it isn't the boon it looks like at first glance. In fact, it highlights a serious problem with the state's budgeting process: it's completely at the mercy of the earnings of the rich.
I wrote about this back in January:.
Actually,. [OR by selling Facebook stock!] This means that they're disproportionately exposed to market volatility. And the markets have been plenty volatile over the past couple of years.
Look, we're lucky to have Facebooks and Googles and Apples in the California economy. But their presence — and the activities of shareholders who pay taxes in the state — isn't going to solve the extremely pressing problems of a budget that's carrying a structural deficit of around $5 billion and that's facing unemployment that could climb above 11 percent again over the next few months (and that's unlikely to fall into the single-digits for years).
So welcome the Facebook effect. Just don't depend on it.
Follow Matthew DeBord and the DeBord Report on Twitter.",What is the serious problem with the state's budgeting process as highlighted in the context?,"The state's budgeting process is completely at the mercy of the earnings of the rich, making it disproportionately exposed to market volatility."
275,"The horsehair bracelet on Blake Greene's wrist is more than just an accessory.
It's a celebration of the lives of her horses, Shady and Dixie. The horses had been with Greene since she was a little girl; both recently passed away.
""To have something like this is really priceless. It's a word that's sometimes overused, but really, it's a cool thing to have them with me all the time,"" Greene, a Tallahassee photographer, said.
Greene couldn't carry this special memory around with her without Lisa Phipps, lead designer of Chic Verte, who created the piece.
""There are so many things that are thrown away or people walk by every day that are beautiful,"" Phipps said. ""They can be repurposed and given new life as treasures or mementos that you can wear and keep with you all the time.""
When translated from French to English, the name of her line, Chic Verte, means ""fashionably green"" — which suits her business well. Every piece is created from natural and environmental materials like wood, feathers, antlers, shells, acorns, shark teeth, eel skin and coral. The environment elements have all fallen on their own and the animal pieces all come from animals that aren't alive any longer.
""The materials I use are really just anything that I come across that I find interesting or pretty,"" Phipps said.
Phipps also encourages people to bring in heirlooms or items of value to incorporate into the jewelry, such as pearls that fell off a relative's pearl necklace, an old compass found during an adventure, or —like Greene — horsehair from family horses. She takes these items and integrates them in with the natural materials to create earrings, belt buckles, bolo ties, necklaces, bracelets or other items.
""When a horse is getting older or about to pass away, I've always taken a cut of my horse's mane or tail and kept it in a box,"" Greene said. ""She (Phipps) gets the importance of taking something that's beyond special and turning it into such a great beauty that I can carry with me.""
The Phipps family has a history in the jewelry making business. Mrs. William Klamp — Phipps' husband's great-grandmother — began making jewelry in Chicago in 1898. Years later, the family business would travel to Tallahassee and be passed down to Phipps. Although she always enjoyed making pieces, Phipps had decided to take a break from the business after her children were born.
That is, until a red oak tree fell on the Phipps family property in September 2013. She became mesmerized by the natural designs and divots in the tree. She got an itch to be creative and knew she had to do something with the wood.
Her husband brought the tree back to her workshop. There she began to make wood sculptures, which would eventually bring her back to jewelry-making.
""I started with sculptures and they were beautiful. But turning it into jewelry, you can take it with you, you can enjoy it,"" Phipps said. ""Especially for people who work inside, they've got this reminder that there's something out there.""
Her workshop is a living testament to the philosophy she holds about her jewelry. The outside space next to her home allows her to embrace the wilderness and channel it into her pieces. There are boxes on top of boxes full of different shapes, sizes and types of wood, feathers and other organic materials.
""Appreciating nature for its beauty and the value of being able to spend time outside is so special for me,"" Phipps said.

1740,"After listening to your comments on the last post I’ve made…and feeling how I am feeling..
Meds sucks.
I feel super hype at night before bed. My heart is pounding, my mouth is dry and I’m always so thirsty! I feel uncontrollable happy, and my head is ringing with a slight headache ever night. The worst is the energy that I can’t seem to burn off.
The good side is I’ve really stopped smoking. I don’t have a craving for anything, and I THINK I have lost weight. I’m not eating as much anymore.
UGH! I want to stop taking it, but my doctor told me this medicine is one that you can not just stop taking, you have to slowly come down off of it.
Today though,
you can be proud of me, well I’m PROUD OF MYSELF. I was feeling really depressed/angry today, and my husband was trying to cheer me up, but I was just snapping on him and being a bitch. I felt really down about a few other things and it built up. Well, he left the house to leave me alone, and I called him just before he left the parking space because I REFUSE TO SIT IN THE HOUSE BY MYSELF, AND BE DEPRESSED OR SAD ANYMORE! I REFUSE! I will not give up on myself, and give into my shitty feeling mode. So, I left the house, got into the car, and went out with him. I kind of a had a semi-breakdown in the car, but never mind that I GOT OUT and changed the way I was feeling. I had a really good night after all, and now know that it might not be ME that makes me feel depressed, but its ME that stays depressed…
Please, if your feeling depressed or sad, GET OUT, move around, go outside, and join life. You will see that even though you hate it, its better than sitting alone…dying.
Lesson learned. Now, if I can only do something quicker about these meds….
5 thoughts on “YOUR RIGHT! MEDS SUCK!!”
Well done for seeking the motivation to ‘do’, it takes a lot of will power and indicates a lot of strength inside of you 🙂
a post I really needed to read right now xx
Hey, you sound sharp! I just emailed someone I had been avoiding (a grandmother), and you are right! Facing that depression makes me feel… strong. Not good, not happy, but fucking strong. Like I can weather the sea!
I want you to know I find a lot of solace in your blog. All the other illness blogs I’ve found I either couldn’t relate to or were preachy. Tomorrow I’m going in for extensive testing for the first time in 7 years. I might get reclassified. I don’t know what that means, but I’m kinda scared. I just gotta be strong, weather it out. Like you! Just get out of the house.
Give the meds a shot, they might just not be the right ones for you. It can be a long process finding the correct ones for you but is worth it! Xx
I know, but it sucks to go through it, you know. I wish there was one magic pill to just take and then BAM…cured lol
Yeah it’s awful. I have been constantly switched between different antipsychotics and antidepressants for over a year now. The magic pill would be great!! Haha",What are the side effects the person is experiencing from their medication?,"The person is experiencing a pounding heart, dry mouth, extreme thirst, uncontrollable happiness, a slight headache every night, and excessive energy that they can't seem to burn off."

A.24 He refers to it as a “reoccurring miracle.”25 And he asserts that this miracle of drought was for the purpose of fulfilling prophecies in Deuteronomy 28 which read: “The LORD will make the rain of your land powder and dust…” (Deuteronomy 28:24). He also points to other prophecies:
You shall bring out much seed to the field but you will gather in little, for the locust will consume it (Deuteronomy 28:38).
The locust shall possess all your trees and the produce of your ground (Deuteronomy 28:42).
Additionally, Rabbi Kohen contends that this reoccurring.26
The Return of the Jews
So, when the Jews started returning to their homeland in the 1890s, they did not find a land “flowing with milk and honey.” Instead, they were faced with trying to eke out a living in a desolate wasteland plagued with malaria-infested swamps. They paid exorbitant prices for the land, and the Muslims who lived there (people who considered themselves to be either Syrians or Turks) laughed all the way to the bank.
The Jews organized themselves into fortress-like communities called either a kibbutz or a moshav.27 These were collective farms that provided mutual help to their members and protection from Arab attacks.
Reclaiming the Land
The pioneers went to work immediately, attempting to drain the swamps and get rid of the malaria infested mosquitos. Eucalyptus trees were imported from Australia and planted around the perimeters of the swamps.28 They were selected because of their reputation for absorbing large amounts of water. When these proved insufficient, canals were dug to drain the swamps to the sea.29.30 They had been cut for firewood and military use, and some forests had been burned for hunting purposes.31 The last sizeable remnants of forests had been cut down in modern times to fire Turkish railway engines.32 I think it is also interesting to note that the Turks taxed trees, so there was an incentive to cut down trees to alleviate the tax burden!33
As the trees were being planted and the land cleared of rocks so that it could be recultivated, the rainfall began to increase miraculously. During the 20th Century, it increased 10 percent every decade, for a total increase of over 100 percent!34
In the fourth and last part of this series on the restoration of the land of Israel, we’ll look at how The Jewish National Fund was used by God to return the Holy Land from desolation to bounty in fulfillment of Ezekiel 36:34-35.

781,"A Sheffield charity which supports children with Encephalitis has won Sainsbury’s Sheffield’s prestigious Charity of the Year accolade – and will celebrate its new partnership by staging a number of fundraising events.
The Eden Dora Trust was set up two years ago by a Sheffield mum named Petrina after her six-year-old daughter Eden became seriously ill with Encephalitis.
Encephalitis is a potentially deadly brain inflammation, which can occur at any time. It can leave a child with life-changing brain injuries and disabilities.
The first of these fundraising events is an awareness day at Sainsbury’s Sheffield’s Archer Road store, consisting of volunteers and supporters of the Eden Dora Trust helping customers to pack their shopping bags whilst raising awareness of childhood Encephalitis. This will take place this coming weekend (Friday 30 September and Saturday 1 October 2016).
The aim of the charity is to help make life better and easier for children and their families and carers affected through support, information, research and rehabilitation.
The Eden Dora Trust is the only charity in the UK dedicated solely to children who suffer from Encephalitis. Charity patrons include Louis Tomlinson, Paul Dickov, Joe Hart and Andrew ‘Freddie’ Flintoff.
Petrina said: “We were very honoured and excited to be chosen as Sainsbury’s charity partner of the year, and we are really looking forward to working together with Sainsbury’s.
“Community is at the heart of everything we do as a charity so to be involved with such a community-focused organisation in a city as friendly and supportive as Sheffield is without doubt a huge boost.
“Eden was very lucky to survive Encephalitis, when so many other children do not. There was nowhere near enough support available, and we knew that we needed to help others. We were adamant that other families and carers were not to go through this devastating illness alone, like we had to.
“Vital funds raised from events such as those on Friday and Saturday will help pioneering research into the causes, diagnoses and treatments of this debilitating illness, produce educational literature, and provide training for families, teachers and health care professionals involved with the ongoing care and rehabilitation affected by this life-changing illness.
“If anyone can spare any time at all to help, whether that’s an hour or two, or the whole day, that would be be amazing. Children are welcome too.”
Further events that the Eden Dora Trust and Sainsbury’s have organised together are:
- A fashion show in Sainsbury’s Archer Road store on Thursday 8 November, 7pm. (contact the Eden Dora Trust for tickets)
- A Christmas Awareness weekend at Sainsbury’s Archer Road store on 2, 3 and 4 December.
The Eden Dora Trust also has places available for the Sheffield Half Marathon – contact the team to secure a place.

1873,"Bah! Hard-drives these days! - Journal of Omnifarious
May. 22nd, 2006
10:24 pm - Bah! Hard-drives these days!
I went to upgrade my router, which had been running for probably over 200 days straight. I finally shut it down because I wanted to push it to the newest version of Fedora Core so I could get the version of openvpn I wanted and properly tie my work network to home.
But, when I brought it back up with the install CD, it couldn't do the install. The partition table was broken and it wanted to try to re-write it. I checked the logs and played with '
dd' a bit and figured out that the first 7 sectors of the disk were bad. All the other sectors were fine. Just the first 7 were bad.
That drive is only 2 years old. It was a Maxtor 40G drive. Needless to say I was seriously ticked.
klicrai graciously went out and bought me a drive today, and I left work early so I could install it. I found some nice tools (TestDisk in particular) on the net that would reconstruct the partition table by looking for the filesystem headers on disk. It worked surprisingly well, especially since the install CD would recognize the USB key I stored it on if I had it in the slot while I booted.
The partition table couldn't be written, but I could use the information to construct a new partition table on the new disk and copy the appropriate sectors from the old disk onto the new disk. I didn't lose any data at all. But it took me a lot of fiddling to make it work right.

Santa Rosa JC won its first ever men’s swimming and diving state title Saturday, with a dominating three-day performance at the CCCAA state meet in Monterey Park.
Paced by its strong relay teams and freshman diver Nico Suissa, the undefeated SRJC men finished 194 points ahead of second place Palomar. For comparison’s sake, women’s champion Orange Coast beat runner-up Diablo Valley by three points.
Of the three-day meet’s five relays, the Bear Cub men won four and had one fourth-place finish.
SRJC swim and dive coach Jill McCormick said success in the relays is all but required for winning a state title because a relay win awards double the points of an individual win.
“If you’re winning the relay battle, you usually win the meet,” McCormick said. “We knew they were super important, and we built our entire lineup around the relays.”
Friday’s 200-yard medley relay by Sean Malley, John Bing, Trent Williams and Nolan Stimple shattered a 14-year-old state record by 2.13 seconds. That race, with a time of 1:29.99, was named performance of the meet.
“There were national records set by other kids this weekend, and they gave that award to us,” said McCormick, who was named men’s coach of the year.
The men came into Saturday with a massive 155-point lead. The Bear Cubs’ point total after two days was better than Palomar’s three-day sum.
McCormick said the huge lead was liberating.
“People tend to swim very fast when they’re mentally relaxed,” she said. “We knew with the situation we were in that no one was going to catch us. We knew we could absorb a mistake.
“I just told them, ‘We’re making history today … You guys put your heart and soul out there the first two days … so go out there and leave your mark and enjoy every minute of it.’”
The relay teams weren’t the only ones turning in record-setting performances for the Bear Cubs. Freshman diver Suissa set a state record in the 1-meter diving on Friday. Suissa, who swept the men’s diving events, was named diver of the year.
Suissa’s coach, Nolan Irwin, was selected diving coach of the year in his first full season. Irwin stepped into the job last year after the sudden death of longtime coach Tim Nobriga, who had been planning to retire at the end of last season.
“We were kind of grooming Nolan to be the head coach last year, and he just kind of jumped in in the middle of all that,” she said.
“Nolan has been (Nobriga’s) protege. … He’s a young coach, but he’s phenomenal. This year was proof of that.”
For the women, freshman Alexandria Holland, who starred at Maria Carrillo, won three events and was named women’s co-swimmer of the year. She set a school record in the 200-yard individual medley Friday.

2264,"When the COVID-19 pandemic started spreading throughout the US in early 2020, Jessica Daly, consumer health librarian at hospital network Orlando (Fla.) Health, knew it was time for her—and other information specialists in the medical field—to step up.
, as well as other consumer health librarians across the country, began offering free webinars in hopes of educating the public about the virus—and perhaps saving lives in the process. Topics ranged from establishing and maintaining basic cleanliness routines to more specific concerns, such as combating fake news about the pandemic.
Webinars proved to be an ideal method for reaching patients who had health questions or were afraid to travel to their physician’s office, Daly says.
“A lot of families reached out to me saying, ‘How can I keep us safe? What can I do?’ Having a trained medical librarian at their disposal free of charge was and continues to be a valuable resource for so many during this most difficult time,” Daly says. Her first COVID-19 webinar, Germ Prevention: Protecting Your Family, was presented in June 2020 on Orlando Health’s website in response to community queries like these.
In that webinar, Daly gave tips on home and personal hygiene, from proper handwashing techniques to the best cleaners for sanitizing household objects. Some of the information may have seemed basic, she says, but it was important to reiterate—especially since certain cleaning products or methods may be new to some people.
“You may have read some really scary things [that] people did because they were just so afraid,” Daly says. “A lot of people think they can mix cleaners, especially with bleach. But you never mix bleach and ammonia. A lot of people do not know that.” (Combining bleach and ammonia produces toxic, potentially fatal gases.)
Those who don’t understand their options for accessing health care will be left behind.
Daly also hosted a webinar on things to consider before leaving the house during the pandemic, with advice on wearing proper face coverings, maintaining social distance, and getting tested after coming into contact with an infected person. The webinar’s goal was to inform and also to provide peace of mind for viewers.
“I never wanted people to be afraid to go out,” Daly says. “If they had to, I wanted them to feel confident when they did.”
Correcting misinformation
The COVID-19 pandemic has also prompted an increase in fake news, especially surrounding the virus’s origins and transmission. That has spurred some librarians to use webinars as a means of countering misinformation.
Antonio P. DeRosa, oncology consumer health librarian at Weill Cornell Medicine Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center in New York City, produced a webinar last May titled Fighting the “Infodemic” of Misinformation on COVID- 19. Webinars are nothing new for DeRosa, who typically focuses on oncology, but the World Health Organization’s decision in February 2020 to call the phenomenon of rampant misinformation an “infodemic” inspired him to highlight the topic, he says.
DeRosa says questions to his office have skyrocketed since the onset of the coronavirus. “I’ve received more questions about things I know are misinformation,” he says, such as the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 and whether face masks really prevent the virus’s spread.
Brenda Linares, health sciences librarian at University of Kansas Medical Center School of Nursing in Kansas City, says she has seen similar misinformation in the Latinx community. Linares hosted a webinar on the topic last August and has frequently discussed health literacy as it relates to the coronavirus in her bimonthly Spanish-language podcast Juntos Radio.
Linares says that since the onset of the pandemic, she had seen a number of English-language podcasts on COVID-19 but not many in Spanish—so she decided to launch Juntos Radio in March 2020. “I thought it would be great to share those resources,” she says. The podcast’s first episode provided COVID‑19 prevention tips; subsequent pandemic-related episodes have dealt with social-distancing best practices and debunking vaccine myths. The podcast has also covered childhood obesity, Alzheimer’s disease, and other topics.
She notes that health literacy is one of the social determinants of health, which include factors such as socioeconomic status and education. Those who don’t understand their options for accessing health care will suffer as a result, she says.
Bringing webinars to your community
Daly hosted more than 40 webinars on topics related to the pandemic for Orlando Health in 2020. She recommends that health librarians hoping to offer similar programs—related to COVID-19 or not—start by sticking to the basics and turning to colleagues for assistance.
“The best thing to do is connect with others who are already doing it,” she says. In her view, asking health literacy professionals—as well as nurses, doctors, and others in your organization—for advice and best practices is crucial. They can offer guidance on content as well as on recording and promoting the webinar. Medical professionals can even be guests on your webinar, she says.
But it’s important to remember that librarians themselves cannot give medical advice: “The consumer health librarian’s responsibility is to provide credible and timely health information,” she says. “Once the patient receives [that] information, it is their responsibility to share it with their physician or medical professional team.”
Even more important, Daly says, is connecting with the community to assess its wants and needs. COVID‑19 remains a huge concern, she says, but people are dealing with other medical issues as well. Daly keeps a list of health care questions that patients pose to her—a list that has led to webinars on cancer prevention, medication safety, planning for an effective doctor’s visit, preparing for surgery, and other topics.
“You don’t need to reinvent the wheel,” Daly says. “But you want to put your own spin on [your webinar] and make it personalized for your area and your participants.”",What were some of the topics covered in the webinars hosted by Jessica Daly during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"Some of the topics covered in the webinars hosted by Jessica Daly during the COVID-19 pandemic included establishing and maintaining basic cleanliness routines, combating fake news about the pandemic, home and personal hygiene, proper handwashing techniques, the best cleaners for sanitizing household objects, and things to consider before leaving the house during the pandemic such as wearing proper face coverings, maintaining social distance, and getting tested after coming into contact with an infected person."
574,"Photor’s 1928 “How Long How Long Blues,” found its most success ful proponent in Brown, who in turn deeply influenced several generations of R&B performers, from Floyd Dixon and Ray Charles to Sam Cooke; Cooke’s 1960 “Bring It On Home to Me” is a direct extension of Brown’s 1959 “I Want To Go Home.” His impact was far-reaching: Atlantic Records co-founder Ahmet Ertegun cites Brown’s ’s One More for the Road up to his most recent Verve titles, he cut a series of stunningly perfect albums that completely outstripped his classic late-’40s–early-’50s recordings. Laden with atmosphere, emotionally charged yet never florid, each was a masterpiece of low-key expression.
That’s no small feat, as Brown’s string of postwar hits — among them “Drifting Blues” (which he had written as a teenager, and which went on to sell hundreds of thousands of copies, becoming Cashbox’s top R&B record of 1946); “Trouble Blues,” No. 1 in ’49; “Black Night,” No. 1 in ’51 — were some of the day’s most finely wrought rhythm & blues. 1949’s “Merry Christmas, Baby” became a perennial after it went to No. 9 on the R&B charts and was subsequently reissued the following year and again in 1954 — come December, you’ll still find it on jukeboxes in black neighborhoods across the country.
Brown first made his mark in wartime Los Angeles as pianist with Johnny Moore’s ‘Drifting Blues’ came out, the birthrate shot up 90 percent!”
As a blues singer, Brown conveyed a sense of abject desolation; he was an inconsolable everyman who cut to the very heart of that most common life experience: misery. Brown’s’s’s ist’s he’ll be posthumously inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame next month further underscores the enormity of this loss.","Who was deeply influenced by Photor's 1928 ""How Long How Long Blues"" and in turn influenced several generations of R&B performers?","Brown was deeply influenced by Photor's 1928 ""How Long How Long Blues"" and in turn influenced several generations of R&B performers."
1728,"An ode to the codes, passwords and secrets that keep the world running.
There, inscribed on the inside of an old notebook, was the code.
Early in their lives, I had drummed this word into my kids’ malleable little heads.
Various relatives knew this word was the trigger to spring various locks.
It was a code word. Ours, and ours alone. Upon hearing it, my children would turn compliant and happily get into the vehicles of anyone who showed up to collect them.
It was a code word. Ours, and ours alone.
On a dark and stormy night, a pirate with an eye patch and a sidearm would be cordially invited in upon uttering the word.
If there was an alphabetic combination required, these five letters were it. The word was … pssssst … Daisy.
Daisy was the name of a family pet.
It was our secret code.
Daisy.
Who sent you?
Daisy.
Let me take your coat.
I’ve had a few codes in my life, and now I have a crossword puzzle’s worth of personal identity numbers and email addresses and passwords. With wearying regularity, I reset many of them. More than one irate clerk has looked heaven-ward as I punched in various near misses into the handheld keypad at a checkout. Three attempts seems a bit … paltry. Perhaps keypads could take a cue from game shows and offer a “care to phone a friend” lifeline? Clearly, credit-card companies don’t care about debt, so why not introduce a sporting element to the transaction?
Clearly, credit-card companies don’t care about debt, so why not introduce a sporting element to the transaction?
So I got to thinking about codes. Had technology eliminated codes? My daughter is waitressing — don’t worry: as a recent undergraduate degree holder, she is entirely qualified to discuss American history while doing so — but, as she communicates with “the line” (a.k.a. the kitchen) via computer only, she will never acquire fluency in diner lingo. Ordering: “Adam and Eve on a raft; easy on the axle grease.” Translation: Two poached eggs on toast, scant use of butter. At lunch counters in dustier corners of the United States, I’ve had the joy of witnessing this dying patois played out, likely for the amusement of people just like me.
(They call us “campers,” people who linger too long at a table.)
Lesley Stowe looks eternally collegiate despite being a heavy hitter in the foodie world. Lesley produces those wonderful couture crackers, Raincoast Crisps, at her Richmond, B.C., factory. I had dinner with her a short while ago and some of her Rockwellian charm was dimmed. Two days earlier, by utter fluke, Lesley had missed a flight out of YVR (code). A Beechcraft King Air 100 had crashed, killing the pilot and hospitalizing virtually all passengers. She had got the news via radio while driving over the Oak Street Bridge. As the flight was filled with colleagues of hers, Lesley went immediately to the hospital. In the gasping disbelief that followed, she found herself navigating hospital privacy policies as she and other friends and family sought information. Throughout it all, there was a persistent announcement: Code Orange. Code Orange.
Throughout it all, there was a persistent announcement: Code Orange. Code Orange.
Whatever it was, Code Orange wasn’t a medical equivalent to “At ease, soldier.” Upon inquiry with medical practitioners and the Coastal Health Authority, I learned that Code Orange indicates that there is going to be a crush of incoming. It’s a sort of hospitalese for All Hands on Deck.

If you watch any TV, you know hospitals use lots of codes. Code Blue is well known from hospital dramas as a cardiac arrest situation. Code Red means, you guessed it, fire. DNR stands for Do Not Resuscitate, although that is under review to be rebranded as the more benign AND, Allow Natural Death. There is a vague uniformity to these codes, but none of them are universal. The notion of codes is so ingrained, however, that medical personnel refer to many serious medical traumas simply as “coding,” as in “the patient was coding.” You may recognize this noun/verb slippage to what has happened at the Olympics: successful participants “medal.”
The military has codes galore. During the Second World War, general Dwight Eisenhower was referred to via the inelegant and more-than-a-bit mysterious moniker of Duckpin. The atomic bomb test at the Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands had the bland handle of Crossroads.
The atomic bomb test at the Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands had the bland handle of Crossroads.
A friend’s brother-in-law is a U.S. congressman. He can dial a certain number, give a certain code word, and a helicopter will swoop in to pick him up. It has to be for a dire emergency, however, and not just to get an aerial view of July 4th fireworks. Far be it from a congressman to misuse public funds, I’m sure.
“Mrs. Johnson” had ready access to the White House as mistress to president Franklin Delano Roosevelt. I’m sure the president didn’t call Lucy Mercer Mrs. Johnson, but the Secret Service did. I imagine Eleanor Roosevelt had her own pet name for Lucy, who was, by the way, her former social secretary.
Ashim D’Silva
Fresh out of university, I was a flight attendant for less than one year. Why airlines are so sticky about departure times, I’ll never know, but I digress. I can tell you this now: We had an internal code to use if the safety of the plane was threatened by hijackers or terrorists. It was a woman’s name. If your name was Noni, you were never going to be hired by a Canadian airline. It would be equivalent to a Bernice Madoff filling in applications at an investment house.
It would be equivalent to a Bernice Madoff filling in applications at an investment house.
I just got off the phone with a career pilot of long haul, jumbo, commercial planes. We talked about how his life changed since 9/11. In an era of air marshals, no-fly lists, titanium and steel-reinforced flight deck doors that have a Mossadian labrinyth of features to keep nuts at bay, the airlines still rely on a secret code word. He said if he told me the word he’d have to kill me.
Then he told me the word.
But that’s OK: I didn’t tell him about Daisy, so the kids won’t let him in the house.","What does the code word ""Daisy"" signify in the context?","""Daisy"" is a secret code word known to the author's family and relatives.

Guide
Start by heading left, where you’ll come across a clearing. If you bring the legendary Pokemon Cobalion, Virizion, Terrakion and Keldeo here, Keldeo will learn Secret Sword and transform into its Resolute Forme . The former three can be caught in this game, but Keldeo can only be obtained via a special event.
To the east of the clearing is a boulder that you can push with Strength. Past here is a deep pool, some items and a Parasol Lady standing in a very awkward position. If it’s Winter, you can’t even stop in front of her to begin a battle!
Nope, there is no way to slide to the Parasol Lady… How’d she even get there?!
Trainer Battle: Parasol Lady
With this little corner fully explored, return to the clearing and slowly make your way clockwise around the moor. Towards the north you can exchange fistcuffs with a male Pokemon Ranger.
Trainer Battle: Pokemon Ranger
Then when you’re ready, leap down the ledge to his south and check out the remaining part of the moor. Around here, you can face two trainers.
Trainer Battle: Fisherman

Known for their extensive touring routine, Brenely started writing the song in Australia nearing the end of a 2 month long trip when she was longing for home. Lisa later helped her finish the song in Grenada. The pair recorded the song in Pro Tools with an acoustic guitar, a snare kick and hi-hat, an upright bass, an organ and a lapsteel guitar.
Both hailing from Scottish small towns in Canada, Brenely and Lisa have chosen a musical path that channels their parent’s vintage record collection that compromised the likes of Neil Young and Dolly Parton.
A total of over $275,000 in cash and prizes will be distributed this year by the year-round contest open to both amateur and professional songwriters. Visit to listen to Madison Violet’s winning song, download their photo and enter the current contest.

Various mechanical stressors may affect your children’s spine and joints : practicing a sport such as soccer, skating, hockey and gymnastics leads to numerous falls and injuries, as do many activities of daily living. Bad posture at school, watching television or playing on a computer are other causes of musculoskeletal disorders for children. Some of these injuries are visible and noticeable by yourself or your child, but at other times they may go unnoticed. A regular chiropractic evaluation can help limit the consequences of those imbalances.

486,"The look of this dish, black and white, gives no clues concerning its flavour. The subtle aniseed and nutty notes of the soup, and unexpected sweetness of the black garlic crumbs, are sure to elicit some interesting responses from your fellow diners.
The cannellini beans are the foundation, in terms of texture and taste, for the sweet aniseed of the roasted fennel and the nutty roasted cauliflower. It is a subtle yet hearty soup, equally at home on a cold winters night, or at a summer lunch.
While the soup is delicious on its own, the black garlic crumble makes it unforgettable. A perfect counterpoint visually, as well as in terms of taste and texture. If you don’t like garlic, don’t let that put you off using black garlic. Changing raw garlic into black garlic is a truly transformational process – black garlic tastes quite different to the raw garlic it used to be, yet is as good for you as it ever was.
Beans are widely available in cans. While very convenient, they are different from cooked fresh or dried beans. Have you ever compared the taste of canned peas to frozen or fresh peas? Almost a different vegetable. Serious Eats has a great post on all aspects of beans – soaking times, fresh versus canned, and the characteristics of different types of beans.
One of the advantages of using dried beans is the opportunity to use aromatics (onion, garlic, and herbs) when cooking them. This will transform the beans into something much more flavorful, especially compared to what you get from a can.

On the Bay - Join us on May 19 and June 2 to plan for the future of Malletts Bay village. Colchester has long envisioned transforming the West Lakeshore Drive neighborhood into a recreation and tourism oriented village center on Mallets Bay, but the lack of infrastructure has stymied those plans for decades. With efforts to address infrastructure needs moving forward, the town will be updating the zoning and development standards for the Malletts Bay village area. Please attend one or both of these sessions to help refine our vision for the future of Malletts Bay village. Read more info about the sessions here (PDF format)

Colchester is the fourth largest community in Vermont with over 17,000 residents. Several important businesses and organizations call our town home: St. Michael's College, Vermont PBS, Vermont Public Radio, and the Vermont Youth Orchestra. We are located on the shores of Malletts Bay (part of beautiful Lake Champlain), which offers access to a range of activities on the lake, including boating, swimming and fishing. Colchester has many parks that invite you to hike, play tennis, enjoy a summer concert or simply relax.
Burlington, a cosmopolitan and collegiate center for the Champlain Valley region, is only minutes away to the south. To the east, the verdant slopes of the Green Mountains beckon to hikers, hunters, skiers and nature lovers. Situated along the Interstate 89 corridor, minutes from Burlington International Airport, rail and bus stations, Colchester offers convenient transportation links. (Photo courtesy of Jeff Lefebvre)

1080,"Quality assurance
All members of the NORAH research consortium are experienced and established scientists who can vouch for the quality and neutrality of the results of NORAH.
The scientific approach also requires, however, that methods and results are constantly reviewed by others. This is why, at the start of the NORAH Study, external scientists were commissioned to monitor the quality of the work of the consortium. This groups of scientists form the Wissenschaftlicher Beirat Qualitätssicherung (Scientific Advisory Board for Quality Assurance - WBQ) to ensure the so-called external quality assurance. Parallel to this, the scientists carrying out the study also subjected themselves to internal quality assurance.
External quality assurance (WBQ)
The Scientific Advisory Board for Quality Assurance (WBQ) was made up of international experts on epidemiology, sleep medicine, cardiology, industrial medicine, acoustics, psychology and noise impact research. The WBQ examined the design of the study as far back as November 2010, i.e. even before the scientific consortium had been selected. Since then the quality assurance body had been meeting regularly with the consortium, examining work reports, and advising on the selection of methods. When the individual NORAH sub-studies were concluded, the WBQ also examined the results and – where necessary – suggested further evaluations before the results were published.

There is substantial evidence that reducing risk factors through both pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods reduces the risk of further cardiovascular events.1
During the last ten years we have seen a reduction in 30-day mortality following an MI from 13% in 2003 to 8% in 2011.2 This has been due to changes in acute management and the application of secondary prevention measures. Secondary prevention encompasses lifestyle changes, drug therapy and medical interventions.2,3

Our neighbor introduced her to me over the summer. She babysits for them and they thought it would be nice for me to know at least one person at school. Nice of her to wave. How obvious is it that I’m sitting here by myself listening to conversations all around me?
I’ve spent all day listening. Homeroom was interesting. Everyone bounding into the classroom excited to see who would be there, to catch up over summer. It didn’t take long to figure out who the popular kids in the room were. If the squeals and hugs hadn’t given it away, the gawking and fawning were impossible to miss. And there was plenty of time piece it all together. Time truly slows down when you’re the 14 year old new kid sitting in the middle of a room of your peers. Is the teacher ever going to show up? Will I finally get a chance to use my voice to at least say “here.”
But that was hours ago. Since then I’ve wandered through halls trying to find classrooms on this sprawl of a campus. My friends from home won’t ever believe that the hallways are outside. Guess we don’t have to worry about the snow here. I suffered through lunch trying not to seem so obviously alone. There is no way I can come back and do this all again tomorrow. Two thousand kids laughing and joking and rushing around, and I’m being carried by the current like a salmon that’s given up.

1995,"On February 1st, 1908 King Carlos I. and Crown Prince Luis Filipe were assassinated in Lisbon.
Two Portuguese republicans Manuel Buiça and Alfredo Costa killed King Carlos I (45) and Crown Prince Luís Filipe (22). Queen Amélia and the second son, Dom Manuel, Duke of Beja (18), survived the assassination with slight injuries. Manuel was proclaimed King Manuel II. Two years later – in 1910 – revolutionaries forced him to flee to Gibraltar. Aged 43 he died in Twickenham on 2nd July 1932.
The republican system pushed Portugal into anarchy, violence, bankruptcy and finally into the Salazar dictatorship which lasted until 1974.
Portuguese Monarchists of the Aliança Internacional Monárquica Portuguesa created an impressive website for the 100th anniversary of this tragedy: . Listen to the Royal Anthem, a gun salute and photos of the coffins of the King and Crown Prince.

434,"In Her Own Sweet Time: One Woman's Unexpected Adventures in Finding Love, Commitment, and Motherhood
I read this book in one day. It, like the author, and like the problems she explores, is not perfect. Like the author, In Her Own Sweet Time is lovable and I eagerly devoured it for the stories she tells, the problems she outlines, and the social phenomena she identifies.
The question “What is the impact of new reproductive technologies (NRTs) on feminism?"" is a recurring motif within this book. On the one hand, women have the unprecedented opportunity to choose when and how to become mothers—with a partner, with donor sperm, through intrauterine insemination, through in vitro fertilization or with the help of a surrogate. Women can freeze eggs at the peak of fertility for later use, and can freeze fertilized eggs for transplantation. Lehmann-Haupt describes all of these reproductive tools and her experience with them. I was delighted to see her go further and wonder about how they relate to feminism—its history, aims, and future. Women are ‘liberated’ to do it all and ""on our own"" (for ""on our own"" read: with an entire medical team. Ahem). The author wants to know whether is it okay—whether is it feminist—to want a partner, to desire love, and to hope for relationship and commitment.
Lehmann-Haupt does unwittingly import some of the old liberal feminist zero-sum assumptions about gender, which blunts the edge of her musing on the relationship between NRTs and feminism. Here, like many 1980s feminists that argued access to abortion makes women more like men and may be problematic to feminism, Lehmann-Haupt wonders if access to NRTs makes women more like men, and so may be problematic to feminism. Both arguments claim that the procedures in question—abortion and NRTs—allow women to deny their biological nature. It’s a convoluted syllogism: women's biological nature includes motherhood; men's biological nature does not include motherhood; when women act against their biological nature to preclude motherhood they are (acting) like men. No, it's not perfect, but hey, it's not my logic.
The fact that Lehmann-Haupt makes such a claim (that egg freezing allows women to deny their biological nature) now, decades past the Sex Wars of the 1980s and all of those old essentialism debates and appears unaware of the problems of this claim is noteworthy. It indicates that the question and meaning of nature is still a problem for feminism, and therefore, for American culture generally. There is still difficulty in developing a robust conception of what woman is and can be that allows for motherhood, but does not require it for ""real"" womanhood.
That being said, I definitely recommend In Her Own Sweet Time. It is refreshing to read about a woman who is struggling with questions about commitment, love, motherhood, technology, and feminism, and who is able to live with those struggles, say imperfect (but often very good) things, go on safari, travel with friends, date and cope with disappointment, and take her own sweet time with all of it.

1106,"ORLEANS — Looking to kayak, surf or art-gaze? What about watch the sunset?
The Orleans Chamber of Commerce says it has just the place for you.
The chamber launched a new magazine last week, named Truly Orleans.
The 50-page color publication is aimed at second-home owners and vacationers, said Noelle Pina, executive director of the chamber.
The chamber had 15,000 copies printed and also soon will have a digital version available for free on its website, orleanscapecod.org, Pina said.
The magazine, which is expected to come out once a year, is replacing a glossy, fold-out map of the town that was used in years prior, chamber officials said. And it goes much farther.
""It was something that had more meat,"" said Erik Oliver, chairman of the Orleans chamber's board of directors.
The magazine features a one-page map, several directories and numerous features such as ""Surfing Orleans,"" ""Owning a Beach Front Home"" and ""Buying Local in Orleans.""
Staff from Enterprise Newspapers, owned by Falmouth Publishing, edited the articles, did design and layout, and helped with advertising strategy, Pina said.
""Because we are in a tourism-based economy, they are always looking for ways to promote their business,"" Pina said of local merchants. ""Some businesses really rely on the chamber to help their business.""
The magazine has a cover price of $4.95, but the publication is expected to be distributed ""at a reduced price"" at various events, Pina said.
It also will be at local businesses, including real estate agents, and will be frequently given out for free, Pina said.
Sean Randall, director of sales for Falmouth Publishing, said Enterprise Newspaper staff helped pick the right type of advertisements to run, based on it being a glossy magazine.
""A lot of newspaper ads make terrible magazine ads,"" he said. ""We worked with the Orleans chamber on what photographs would translate the best and be vibrant, and what would not work.""
Randall said the chamber made a smart decision by not just focusing on stories about local businesses, but putting together a lifestyle magazine about the entire town.
Falmouth Publishing puts out its own lifestyle magazine, called Simply Falmouth, which also comes out once a year. Its first edition was last June.
Another local magazine that covers a specific town is Chatham Magazine, which was recently part of a group of publications bought by Lighthouse Publications.
Russell Piersons, president and CEO of Lighthouse Publications, hasn't seen the Orleans publication but said some of the reasons that Chatham Magazine works are that the town is a destination, it's large enough and has plenty of high end businesses and shoppers.
Pina said membership dues helped start up the Orleans magazine and revenue has mostly come from advertisements.
Candace Hammond, a freelance writer who lives in Orleans, wrote multiple articles for the inaugural edition.
""I'm a big believer in shopping local and supporting local businesses,"" she said. ""I think its a great idea in getting into greater detail about what these stores can offer.""",What is the purpose of the new magazine launched by the Orleans Chamber of Commerce?,"The new magazine, named Truly Orleans, is aimed at second-home owners and vacationers.

and choose Workflow – New Project
There are a few steps in the photo to 3d model operation; you can choose to carry out all of these in sequence for you by ticking the “Compute 3D Model
after project creation” and “Compute Texture after Surface extraction” options.
(Note, although it is more convenient to do these all in one go, working through stage by stage does give you more control and it will let you spot and fix problems earlier on)
Hit Next to show Photo Selection – just drag your photos into this panel (50 photos maximum with this version of Zephyr).
– Zephyr also has a neat tool here that lets you bring in a video you might have made of your subject (or rather it will let you bring in a video file, extract still photos from it and then use those photos). Be careful with video imports as they tend to be more blurry.
Hit NEXT to proceed until you get to the orientation presets panels. This is where you describe the project and how detailed you want it.
The categories of
• General
• Close Range
• Aerial
• Urban
• Human Body
do work well as described but if one set gives bad results try experimenting; CLOSE RANGE / DEEP is the most successful – but longest and most complex combination
The different levels of preset will obviously affect time taken and complexity achieved – but be aware pushing up the detail levels is not the answer to a bad set of photos.
Click RUN at the top of the final panel to start the process. This can take a while but you can launch multiple Zephyr instances again and again to have it working on more than one model.
All being well you will eventually see a 3d model generated from your set of photographs. You can pan and zoom around the model (or right click – camera – view from – front / left / top etc.). There’s an EXPORT – SCREENSHOT if you want to grab a snap of your model at this stage.
In the example here the software has only detected common points with 8 out of the 31 photographs taken – it has not reconstructed the back of the statue, there area some holes in the model and some of the background has
bled into the hat. It may still be usable but you can see that if the photographs were better lit, better focused and more composed (with less noisy backgrounds) the results would be much better.
There are a lot of tools within Zephyr to let you do some repairs on your model; use Tools – Selection – Manual Selection to pick and cut parts you do not want; this is very useful. Also (clumsy) hole filling tools for patching gaps.
The Mesh Decimation filter is an essential one for simplifying meshes – so they are handled better by Rhino, etc. You can lower complexity and keep perfectly fine models.
On the right hand side of the Zephyr screen there is also a basic keyframe animator, so you could make a quick fly-around of your model. Click Add all camera positions, then the play button. You can export this by pressing the Record button.
To export your model for use in Rhino, 3Ds, Sketchup, etc. – or to send it
for 3D printing choose Export – Export Textured Mesh, or – Choose Obj/MTL for the output format (this will work fine with 3D applications)
– Click the Local Rendering Reference System box
then select the folder you want to output to – it will create a mesh, and
the files needed to wrap the textures around your object. Leave these all
in the same folder.
This OBJ file is now ready to open / drag into, for example, Rhino – though it will most likely be requiring rescaling to ensure it is proper size.
This full export will actually consist of 3 files – the model and also the files that describe the texture wrapped around it. These files should all be kept together otherwise the model will just render with no texture",What are the steps to create a 3D model using 3DS Zephyr Free?,"To create a 3D model using 3DS Zephyr Free, start the program and choose Workflow – New Project. There are several steps in the photo to 3D model operation, which can be carried out in sequence by ticking the “Compute 3D Model after project creation” and “Compute Texture after Surface extraction” options. Drag your photos into the Photo Selection panel, and proceed until you reach the orientation presets panels. Here, you describe the project and its desired detail level. Click RUN at the top of the final panel to start the process. After the 3D model is generated, you can pan and zoom around it. There are tools within Zephyr to repair your model, and the Mesh Decimation filter can simplify meshes. You can also use the keyframe animator to create a quick fly-around of your model. To export your model for use in other applications or for 3D printing, choose Export – Export Textured Mesh, or – Choose Obj/MTL for the output format."

1630,"London’s ULEZ scrappage scheme running out of cash
- Oops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.
A £61m scrappage fund to help London motorists avoid paying the ultra-low emission zone charge has less than £2m left, Sadiq Khan has revealed.
This means that fewer than 1,000 more drivers will be able to obtain a £2,000 grant to scrap a vehicle that fails to comply with the Ulez exhaust emission rules.
The zone expands from central London to the inner boundaries of the North and South Circular roads in 10 days, on October 25. Vehicles that breach the rules will have to pay £12.50 a day to enter or drive within the enlarged zone.
The Mayor on Thursday night said that only £1,917,348 of uncommitted funds remained in the car and motorcycle scrappage scheme, as of October 11.
Londoners on income support or disability benefits can apply to the scheme, which Mr Khan said had already enabled more than 12,000 non-compliant vehicles to be taken off the road - 6,700 cars, 5,200 vans, 100 HGVs and 20 coaches.
He signalled at Mayors Question Time on Thursday that he would try to continue to help low-income Londoners.
The Ulez expansion is expected to generate about £1.9m a day for Transport for London – plus income from the £160 penalty tickets that will be issued to drivers who fail to pay.
Susan Hall, leader of the GLA Conservatives, who obtained the scrappage fund figures, said: “Unless the Mayor urgently invests in scrappage schemes, struggling Londoners who can’t buy a new vehicle without help will be hit by a daily charge they can’t afford.
“There’s no excuse for the Mayor to let London’s scrappage schemes run dry. The Ulez charge will raise millions of pounds a year and we’ve identified £50 million the Mayor could use right now to help Londoners switch vehicles and avoid the charge.”
The Standard revealed on Thursday that thousands of motorists who applied to the scrappage fund had had their application delayed or rejected.
By September 20, TfL had received 19,594 applications but had accepted 8,132 and paid out only on 6,854. Only about half of applications are likely to be accepted.
Mr Khan said the expansion of the Ulez zone would have huge health benefits for Londoners.
He said the central London Ulez, which launched in April 2019, had almost halved roadside nitrogen dioxide levels.
Widening the scheme - to an area 18 times the size - would “directly benefit more than 200,000 Londoners with asthma living within the boundary of the expanded zone”, he said.
It would also result in nine out of 10 roads inside the zone having NO2 levels under the Government target of 40â¯microgrammes per meter cubed.
However, Green London Assembly member Zack Polanski said the Ulez would not take air quality under 10â¯micrograms per meter cubed, the new guidelines from the World Health Organisation.
Mr Polanski said: “Reaching these new lower limits requires serious and concerted action, which means we must reduce traffic in London – clean air doesn’t just mean changing the vehicles we use; it means changing the way we get around our city.”
A 2019 study by Imperial College found that toxic air contributed to the premature death of 4,000 Londoners.
Mr Khan denied the Ulez expansion and the difficulty for businesses to switch to compliant vehicles was contributing to supply chain problems in the UK economy.
“I have received no representations from businesses around any concerns of supply of essential goods is because of Ulez expansion,” he said.
Thousands of ULEZ scrappage scheme applications rejected
When and where is the Ulez zone expanding and who will have to pay?

The Return of Moqtada al-Sadr
September 2005
.
From the start of the intervention, al-Sadr spoke out against the United States' plans in Iraq. When Washington finally recognized the true threat that al-Sadr posed to the success of its intervention, he had already fortified his power in the vacuum that was created after the fall of the Ba'ath Party establishment. American forces detained some of his associates, and in response al-Sadr ordered his militia to attack U.S. positions. [See: ""What To Do With Moqtada Al-Sadr""]
Al-Sadr's April 2004 uprising briefly overwhelmed the U.S. military, which had been struggling to defeat the predominately Sunni Arab and foreign Islamist insurgency. It forced the Pentagon to divert its resources in Iraq from fighting this insurgency to dealing with the Mehdi Army; it also had a negative effect on the Bush administration's political situation since it appeared briefly that the United States was facing a popular uprising.
In August 2004, al-Sadr launched another revolt. While the Mehdi Army caused many casualties to U.S. troops, they also took a pounding from American forces. Near the end of the August fighting, there was talk that Washington was considering assassinating al-Sadr, but his popularity within the Shi'a community made him too explosive for the U.S. to eliminate. [See: ""Terminating Al-Sadr Will Not Eliminate Shi'a Resistance""]
Therefore, al-Sadr called his militia to step down and shielded himself behind more prominent Shi'a religious leaders. The U.S. decided against assassination, and was happy to see an end to the Shi'a struggle. This gave the U.S. military the opportunity to concentrate its resources on the Sunni Arab and foreign Islamist insurgency.
Al-Sadr and the Shi'a Religious Establishment
Iraq's Shi'a religious leaders chose to protect al-Sadr because of his popularity within the Shi'a community in Iraq, especially among the masses of poor. Additionally, the ability of al-Sadr to muster up his impressive militia in defense of Shi'a values remains an important asset for Shi'a leaders especially since the Shi'a community as a whole has been targeted by what appears to be former Ba'athists, Sunni Arab militant groups and foreign Islamists.
However, Shi'a leaders wanted to participate in the political process since an Iraqi constitution would theoretically result in a power-sharing relationship that gives the Shi'a the most control due to the fact that they constitute a majority in Iraq. During this process, al-Sadr remained relatively quiet, and appeared to be pursuing a more political role. His Mehdi Army continued to provide security in Sadr City, but clashes between his militia and U.S.-led troops had ended.
However, in the lead-up to the October 15, 2005 referendum on Iraq's proposed constitution, he returned to the public spotlight by rejecting the document. He also put on a demonstration of force through his Mehdi Army followers, as seen in the September 25 clash with U.S. and Iraqi troops. [See: ""The Implications of Iraq's Proposed Constitution""]
Additionally, it appears that in his rejection of the constitution, al-Sadr placed himself at odds with the rest of the Shi'a leadership. It is not clear whether his rejection was because of the separatism evident in the proposed constitution, or because of his refusal to participate in any aspect of a process that is affiliated with the U.S. since that would somewhat legitimize what al-Sadr perceives as a continued occupation.
The Bottom Line
Al-Sadr must remain careful because he is positioning himself against the Shi'a hierarchy, in addition to against U.S.-led troops. His Mehdi Army affords him a significant amount of negotiating leverage with these two factions, and both factions recognize his influence with the country's poor masses. That being said, by opposing the country's Shi'a religious leaders, such as Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, al-Sadr could alienate some of his followers.
Indeed, it appears that in recent days al-Sadr has backtracked from opposing the Shi'a hierarchy. For instance, a senior al-Sadr aide, Hazem al-Araji, recently stated that al-Sadr's position on the proposed constitution ""is neutral,"" which was a change from his earlier rejection of the document.
Look for al-Sadr to continue to display the force potential of his Mehdi Army militia, especially in the face of Al-Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's declaration of war against Iraq's Shi'a population, in addition to the upsurge in violence that is predicted to occur as the October 15 referendum date draws near.

The Dallas Stars proved a worthy adversary once again on Friday night but ultimately found unforced errors to be their undoing in a rather demoralizing 3-2 loss to the Anaheim Ducks.
The Stars opened the scoring on the power play after Jamie Benn drew a spearing penalty from Corey Perry, with Alex Chiasson finishing off a beautiful tick-tack-toe triangle passing play down low. The Stars would continue to control play through most of the first period and really put the pressure on Anaheim with an aggressive forecheck and some truly outstanding defensive backchecking by the forewards, but it wasn't enough to keep the Ducks off the scoreboard.
Eric Cole, fighting through some chewed up ice along the boards, tried to move the puck into the middle and it picked off by Ryan Getzlaf who roofed a shot in tight to tie the game just a few minutes before the end of the period.
The second on paper went well for the Stars up until the final few minutes of the frame, once again. The Ducks were able to slowly seize the momentum and tilt the ice in their favor, yet Dallas was able to get into lanes and block shots and survived lengthy cycles by Anaheim without surrendering too many prime chances. Yet again, however, it was a turnover that doomed the Stars.
A hot pass from Tyler Seguin to Jamie Benn was quickly burped up to Corey Perry, who drew back and ripped a powerful shot in stride past Kari Lehtonen to give the Ducks the lead and all the momentum in the game. The Stars had slowly been pulled off their game by the relentless forecheck and aggression by the Ducks and the strategy has certainly worked so far -- the Ducks have feasted on Dallas turnovers and both goals were the product of turnovers with a Duck right in the face of the Stars.
The same problems from the first game continued to plague the Stars in the third; Dallas came out charging hard to open the final frame, but couldn't cash in on several very prime opportunities before drawing a delay of game penalty to once again test their troubled power play.
Instead, the Ducks took advantage of a blown slashing call to score shorthanded on a fire drill in front of Kari Lehtonen. It was the third goal in which Lehtonen went down low and the shot went high, and suddenly the Stars were facing another two-goal deficit in the third period and all of the momentum on the side of the Ducks.
Ryan Garbutt made the game interesting by atoning for a bad first period penalty and scoring off a rebound midway through the third period, kicking off a long stretch of near-dominant play by the Stars that saw a lot of pressure but not a heck of a lot of actual rubber on net. Once there were about five minutes remaining in regulation the Stars really turned on the afterburners and were foiled several times on some prime chances by Freddie Andersen.
The Stars would be afforded a crucial power play with just under three minutes remaining, in a game where the man-advantage was anything but effective. Kari Lehtonen was pulled with just over 90 seconds remaining to give the Stars a short-lived two-man advantage and the siege yielded some big chances -- but ultimate the effort late in the game was not going to be enough.
The Stars once again put the pressure on Anaheim but costly turnovers and some rather unfortunate goaltending would be their downfall. The Stars now head back to Dallas facing a near-insurmountable 2-0 deficit in this series and now it's all about trying their hardest to make this interesting.

1643,"This calzone is easy enough to throw together in 30 minutes and you’ll be a hero in your kitchen! Once you crack it open you smell the metled cheese, the yummy herbs that add such flavor and, and… you want to make this!
This post is to celebrate having my camera back! For the last 5 months I’ve been using an “old camera” (a semi-broken, duct-taped together older camera)… but I keep it around for posterity sake. It was my first digital camera … and it inhabits a soft spot in my heart.
THAT SAID, I’m once again getting used to this camera and feel the need to apologize for some of the blurryness (even though it’s only in a picture or two). Pardon me, just getting reacquainted after 5 months…
However, my camera issues didn’t keep me from being a hero in the kitchen tonight!
Here’s where I started: prepared pizza dough, some dried herbs, crumbled bacon, pepperoni, mozzarella and ricotta cheeses and some garlic-infused olive oil.
But first preheat your oven… to 425 degrees F.
Mix together the cheeses, herbs, bacon and a pinch of red pepper flakes (not pictured here). Toss in the crumbled bacon.
Roll out the prepared pizza dough to about 12-14 inches (on a lightly floured surface).
Note on the pizza dough: I bought it at Trader Joe’s, already prepared. It’s sold in the refrigerated section (near the cheeses). And they sell both “plain” and “whole wheat”. Tonight we went with the plain…
Pile the filling on one half of the dough (spreading it out evenly), top with pepperoni, leaving at least an inch of dough at the edge of the crust.
Drizzle with some of the garlic-infused olive oil and pull the other half of the dough over the filling.
Crimp the edges together and curl the dough under slightly.
Transfer calzone to a broiler pan and drizzle/brush on a little more garlic-infused olive oil.
Bake in a 425 degrees F oven, on a rack positioned in the middle of the oven, until it puffs up nicely and browns (about 18-20 minutes).
Remove from broiler pan with a pizza peel and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. And it doesn’t hurt to grate some fresh parmesan over the top… right?!
Cut it into a few pieces and serve up… but more than that, ENJOY!
You’ll be the hero too!

A member of the audience shares some thoughts about The 3rd season Stranger Things at IMDB:
¨Season 3 was garbage. It seemed like the writers were tasked to see what people liked about the show and just fill the story line with them. It had excessive use of brands. The 80s music were just injected every where for no reason: every time a person entered the scene, 80s music was blasting loudly. Dialogs were extremely predictable and cheesy. Each character's personality was unnecessarily exaggerated: Hopper is always angry and unreasonable, Erica was constantly sassy but the smartest person ever, the mayor is the worst person in the world, the whole newspaper crew were excessively mean. And finally, the whole plot with the Russians was cheap and not at all well thought out. It was hard to finish the season really.¨

It was only the third meeting between the county rivals since 2001 but the Lilywhites have still not beaten Bolton at Deepdale since 1992.
Preston, who had lost their last four games, started the better and came close twice in the sixth minute as Paul Gallagher worked a short corner before testing Alnwick at his near post and Paul Huntington could not guide the ball on target from the second corner.
And the hosts came close again 10 minutes later with Gallagher producing a superb delivery from a free-kick which was flicked inches wide of the far post by Barkhuizen from 12 yards.
The hosts were the dominant side throughout the first period - especially threatening down the left wing - as Kevin O'Connor burst forward on the overlap after 29 minutes and picked out Stephy Mavididi, who could not find the target from 12 yards.
Bolton had their first opportunity on the half-hour mark as a loose ball dropped for Vela on the half-volley from 15 yards but his fierce drive was tipped over by Maxwell.
On-loan Arsenal forward Mavididi was chosen to lead the line in place of the suspended Jordan Hugill and had an opportunity on the stroke of half-time, but his scuffed effort was easy for Alnwick.
Callum Robinson had the first strike on target of the second half, launching a dipping strike from 20 yards but it was comfortable for Alnwick.
The game began to get stretched and Bolton came more into the contest - Adam Armstrong jinking his way down the wing after 65 minutes before cutting back on his right foot and forcing Maxwell to parry away low to his left.
Down the other end Preston were resorting to strikes from distance as Alan Browne unfurled one from 30 yards, that was once again simple for Alnwick.
The Trotters' Darren Pratley almost broke the deadlock with 15 minutes remaining thanks to a thunderous 20-yard strike that whistled inches over Maxwell's crossbar but the game was to finish goalless.",When was the last time Preston North End beat Bolton at Deepdale?,Preston North End last beat Bolton at Deepdale in 1992.
1978,"In 2010, it’s officially beyond a doubt that “cougar” is a part of our cultural lexicon. That’s especially true now that the 40-years-and-older women who date younger men have their own beauty pageant.
Los Angeles resident CC Perkinson was crowned Miss Cougar 2010 Del Mar last week in the second annual contest. The LA Weekly reports she received over 1,600 votes via Twitter and texting, beating out 24 other women for the, um, prestigious title.
My first reaction, as a feminist, is to roll my eyes. The concept of women lining up to be be judged in a “beauty” competition is offensive enough, as is the widespread exclusion of trans women from pageants and, for that matter, men. Then there’s the term cougar itself, which implies that an older woman who pursues hot young men is just like a predatory animal that can maul and eat you. Ouch.
And yet, some women are now happily embracing the cougar title and crown. Are we seeing cougar shift from negative connotations to positive ones? The Del Mar pageant rules benignly define cougar as “a mature woman who pursues younger men, typically more than eight years her junior.”
Miss Cougar 2010, CC Perkinson, actually seems pretty badass. Perkinson was a Del Mar jockey from 1998 to 2005, so gets big kudos right there for being a woman working in a physically demanding, male-dominated industry. (Perhaps that was a point in her favor: Oddly enough, the Del Mar Cougar pageant is actually named after a horse: hall-of-fame racehorse Cougar II.) After winning the pageant, she told NBC Los Angeles:
You can learn from the older, you can learn from the younger and you can have such a great time, and that’s what this is about.
In a culture that remains uncomfortable with unmarried women, it’s nice to hear a positive take on aging-while-female. Perkinson added:
You’ve got to get it in your mind you’ve got a lot to offer. It empowers women to keep a healthy mind, keep a healthy body, reinvent yourself and realize there’s men out there that are attracted to you.
So what do you think: Is cougar inherently offensive? Or can it be reclaimed?

Dating younger men, OK. The term, not so OK.
I am THREE (count 'em, 3) years older than my husband and I have had the term ""cougar"" applied to me. It's ridiculous.
What's the term for men who date younger women? It's ""men"". We don't need to apply a special term to women who date younger men.
I didn't mind the term when it first came out. I actually saw it as a term of empowerment and ownership of one's sexuality. Then it became popular and (like everything else) the more people used it, the more annoying it became and lost any meaning of power. That said, I do think it is more akin to the term ""meterosexual"". It is more annoying and overused than anything although of course it has sexist/homophobic undertones.
I have heard that Larry King, Michael Douglas and other older men don't get the same label which, to an extent, could be true. That said, I have always had a term for men such as this – Dirty Old Man. It isn't exactly a term of endearment.
Kay —
It's true, we do have the terms ""dirty old man"" and ""lech"" to refer to older men who date younger women — but those are usually applied in cases where the guy is MUCH older — like old enough to be her parent. Larry King, for example, is 26 years older than his current wife. But when was the last time you heard those kinds of terms applied to the likes of Brad Pitt, who is 11 years older than Angelina Jolie? If she were the older of the two, the media would have undoubtedly pointed it out ad nauseum, whereas in his case it's just accepted as the normal order of things.
Cougar comes from the effect of a radical face lift. The skin is pulled back from the jaw and cheeks , making the cheekbones very prominent. Eyelids are elongated and slightly tilted. The look isn’t quite human, more feline. Check out what a cougar’s face looks like.
I agree that the term ""cougar"" is given to women unfairly and I applaud women who are trying to redefine it. Unfortunately, I think it will be a long time before the word will be a positive term.
There’s nothing wrong with an older woman dating, having a relationship with, or marrying a younger man. Men have been doing it for centuries. It’s time for us woman to do what makes us happy and not be concerned about what others may think.
I think the word is loosing its teeth and its no depiction of the true person who is attracted to the younger man….attraction is a matter of preferance.",Who was crowned Miss Cougar 2010 Del Mar?,CC Perkinson was crowned Miss Cougar 2010 Del Mar.

Abstract
Background: Enhancing the prescribing competency of medical students will help them evaluate each case based on their knowledge. It will help them prescribe independently and they will also be able to empathize and counsel patients effectively. In view of this, it was planned to implement a module on prescribing competency and assess the same for undergraduate medical students. Methods: Faculty training to implement the module was conducted by eminent faculty in this area. After a pre-test, a workshop was conducted for students, wherein they were trained on rational prescribing based on WHO guide to good prescribing followed by small group discussions to identify P (personal) drugs for bronchial asthma and later with comorbidities. Students had to write a prescription and practice communicating the same to a standardized patient. The module was evaluated using a check list (from the WHO guide) and compared with a pre-test. A feedback was provided to the students at the end of the assessment. Results: The scores (median and interquartile values) for prescribing significantly improved from 5 (2, 7) to 25 (24, 27), maximum score being 30. The scores for the communication also increased from 17.5 (14, 24.25) to 53 (52, 55), maximum score being 60, in the post-test. The differences were statistically significant p < 0.01(Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test). The students expressed that their critical thinking and problem solving capabilities had increased and more importantly ‘they felt like a doctor’. Conclusion: More such modules need to be prepared and prescribing competency needs reinforcement during the clinical years of the medical curriculum for its effective implementation communicating the same to a standardized patient. The module was evaluated using a check list (from the WHO guide) and compared with a pre-test. A feedback was provided to the students at the end of the assessment.",What was the impact of the module on prescribing competency for undergraduate medical students?,"The implementation of the module significantly improved the students' prescribing scores from 5 (2, 7) to 25 (24, 27), with the maximum score being 30.

I like the idea of sticking to the stock ROM as much as possible.

That being said, things like CFQ and the Interactive scheduler are useful to have as an option.

737,"Hello myfitspirationers!! If most of you follow me on twitter (in case you don’t, join the party @BL11Hannah), you will know that I recently researched the HCG diet after watching a friend inject herself with the hormone on a lunch date with my gal pals. I was confused, thinking “Since when do you have diabetes?” Her explanation came after I was told that the injection was HCG known as Human Chorionic Gonadotropin. HCG is a hormone found in the urine during pregnancy that is the latest weight loss quick fix craze. In theory, the HCG hormone is supposed to suppress hunger and trigger your body’s use of fat for fuel. Which is what BootCamp does for me ;)!! I recently read that the hormone is now coming from female horse urine. Is that something you are comfortable injecting yourself with or putting underneath your tonque? If so, I would just stop reading now! 😉
Believe me when I say, I am no stranger to quick fix diets! If you know me on a personal level, you will know that I am obsessed, that’s right
OBSESSED with infomercials! I was the first human to ever buy Oxyclean. Olivia calls my spare bedroom the exercise graveyard where made-for-TV exercise equipment go to die. To name a few….The Ab Circle Pro, The Ab Glider, Brazil Butt Lift (still have high hopes for that one), Food Lovers Fat Loss System, The Ab Dolly, Electro Muscle Stimulator…Need I go on? If you’re like I WAS, I bought into everything. I was so desperate to lose the weight quickly that I watched tons of money circle the drain as my diet dreams of success fell further and further from reality. Why did I ever think it was ok to eat Velveeta Cheese AKA: Liquid Gold for breakfast wrapped in bacon and lose weight? Hello low carb and lovin it! Eeek, so many diets so little time. Yet, I still managed to get close to 300 lbs. When I stepped on the ranch of the Biggest Loser, or should I say, when Olivia dragged me by my hair kicking and screaming, I was just waiting for production to give us a blue speckled pill (you know what I’m talkin about) a shot or lightening fat zapper. How else do those people lose so many pounds in a week?
Then came the first workout.
Jillian Michaels perched on my treadmill and announced to the ranch team “You’re gonna move more and eat less, the quality of your food is going to out-weigh the quantity and you will literally heal your sick bodies with food”. Excuse me? Did I sign up for this? This sounds like my Weight Watchers hell! Even though I think WW is one of the best plans out there, I didn’t want to do it again! Flashes of “Congrats, you lost a quarter of a lb this week” ran through my mind. Then Olivia pulled me aside and said “Have we really given our bodies a chance to heal through diet and exercise?”
Well…..um…..errrrrr….I’ve tried everything, right? WRONG. I had never really trusted my body for a SIGNIFICANT length of time to truly operate the way it was created to, without all of this excess weight! So I committed to the old fashioned way and low and behold it worked! My body began processing chemical free food, I had energy, my mood was better (except when Olivia made me wake up early) and miracles happened! My oily skin and hair became dryer, my skin clearer, I even had less hair on my legs to shave. Ridding my body of excess hormones by eating organic, pesticide and chemical free changed everything. I didn’t even miss my infomercials because for once I was starting to break the cycle. That’s when I became one of those people I loathed in the past who preached “Lifestyle” and guess what? I got one! My very own lifestyle!
Does doing things this way take more time? Yes. More effort? Yes.
BUT….It will get you off the yo-yo diet train for life. Food and exercise and A LOT of prayer, healed my body from the inside out. I learned discipline, worked on my confidence and was finally able to de-cloud my mind of this Quick-Fix syndrome that I had been oh so accustomed to! My blood pressure stabled, I became fertile, and I began to see life in a different way. Healthy can be a state of mind but it is also a walk. Sometimes you fall, sometimes you don’t, but the point is, you keep walking! I started researching long term effects of fad diets. Heart attacks, high blood pressure, cancer, heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, starvation, vital organ shut downs, and so many more. So ask yourself, is this really worth it in the LONG RUN? We all know there is no “Quick” way to make money! So why would you think the same about your body? Why would you treat yourself this way and for what? So I challenge you to quit the quick fix (say that 10 times fast). Lay down the diets, and get yourself a lifestyle! After all, you’re worth it and so are those higher priced groceries. We spend so much $$ on our homes and cars, why wouldn’t you on your body? This blog is for EVERY person out there who has tried the quick fix and failed. NO MORE! You deserve better and so do your children’s children. Trust me, you will thank me later!! If anyone is trying to figure out how to wrap velveeta cheese in bacon without it melting, it can’t be done, I’ve tried. Step AWAY from the yellow box!!
Now, below in the comments, I want to hear the fad diets you’ve tried and did they work??? Don’t be shy, Let’s hear it!!!",What is the HCG diet and where does the hormone come from?,"The HCG diet involves injecting oneself with the HCG hormone, known as Human Chorionic Gonadotropin, which is found in the urine during pregnancy.

1160,"Parallel Progression is Tricky
Over the weekend, Gabe got to check out Mines of Moria at PAX, the first expansion to The Lord of the Rings Online. What he's been talking about the most since seeing it is the way that your character's weapons can progress right alongside them, acquiring legendary status in their own right, and hefty stats boosts as a matter of course. In the context of an MMO that's primarily focused on PvE, this is cool; the worst that can happen is that a class/item combination is favored over all others. It gets a little more tricky when you apply this to PvP. Think about how restrictive enchant and gem choices can be when you're suiting a WoW character up for PvP.
Levels in Battlefield Heroes will factor into matchmaking, and determine how many abilities you have access to, as well as how far you've upgraded them. Though I should probably reserve judgment until more of DICE's vision has made its way into the beta, I'm tempted to say that Battlefield Heroes should go no further than this. I suspect that it will be challenging enough to balance without it going one layer deeper -- like allowing character to level up specific weapons, or creating abilities that govern how effective they are with certain vehicles.
I like that the combat is paced like an MMO; the prolonged firefights are long enough at this point to allow for interesting stuff to happen (like sudden reinforcements, or a crucial ability coming out of cooldown) without feeling contrived. Add too much more complexity and you risk making the game feel overwrought, and more difficult to keep sound as a side effect.
Don't Forget: You're a Shooter
When I play shooters, the most I'm asked in terms of premeditation is to choose a weapon loadout. Conversely, when I think about of doing some WoW PvP, I'm on boards reading about talent specs, team compositions, and UI add-ons. EA says that Battlefield Heroes is all about the ""casual"" experience; I'm having trouble believing that. But if I could jump in and out as ""casually"" as I do in Team Fortress 2, that's good enough.
My big reservation is that Heroes will require all sorts of forethought; that I'll be thinking about how ""viable"" and ""competitive"" certain specs are before I jump in to play. That would certainly keep me from getting earnestly into it.
In its current state of beta, Battlefield Heroes is pretty barebones. This leads me to believe that DICE is having these same dialogues internally, iterating on this spare framework and taking advantage of the game's liberating business model to build it at their own pace.

1263,"Blogging is one of the easiest ways to share information about your company and increase its presence online. Unfortunately, the thought of blogging every day, or even a few times a week, is daunting for most people, especially executives in charge. They fear saying the wrong thing, or writing the wrong thing or simply doing the wrong thing online and leaving their company or themselves open to serious repercussions.
I can’t help but wonder why. Writing a regular blog is no more difficult or dangerous than posting a company newsletter or sending a company wide e-mail. If the person writing the blog has thoughts and can form sentences, they stand a pretty good chance of being to write a decent post every day.
A blog post doesn’t need to be equivalent to ‘War and Peace.’ They don’t need to reveal earth shattering secrets with every post. All they need to do is write something engaging, share some simple information about the company; something relevant to the day-to-day operation of their business. They can share pointed anecdotes, insights or just something interesting that happened recently. This isn’t rocket science folks. It’s blogging.
There are also an assortment of sites devoted to helping hesitant bloggers find their way, learn the ropes and compose a better blog, without having a nervous breakdown.
Your company executives should be blogging. There’s no question about it.
They have a tremendous insights and information to share. Those interested in the company, and even those who work for the company, are interested in the perspectives of the people running it. The audience is there. It’s time to grab it.
Whether your top execs will be sharing company news and information, asking for feedback, positioning themselves as thought leaders, or just blogging because “everyone else is doing it,” getting them started is half the battle. Here are the most common questions (and my answers, based on years of experience working with executives) that execs ask about blogging:
1. How much time is blogging going to take me?
Executives are busy people. They are in high demand and work on many things at once. Everything they choose to participate in comes at the cost of giving up something else. So don’t over-commit.
Start with a reasonable schedule of posts, such as one per month. Block out time in the calendar to make it a real deliverable. If it turns out that blogging more often is doable, then fantastic. It’s better to undersell and over-deliver.
2. For how long am I signing up to do this?
Starting a blog doesn’t necessarily mean that it will continue in perpetuity. The notion of not being able to sustain a blog long term can be a hindrance to getting started in the first place.
Start with an open mind and do it for only as long as it works and feels like a good way to communicate. When contributing to the blog is no longer fun, it’s time to take a break or reset expectations for frequency of posts. Don’t automatically hold to the standard of another blogger who posts more frequently.
But also know that blogs, just like communities, are not an “if I build it, they will come” experience. It takes time, passion, and compelling content to build an audience. So don’t throw in the towel too soon after getting.",What are some common questions executives ask about blogging?,"The most common questions executives ask about blogging are ""How much time is blogging going to take me?"" and ""For how long am I signing up to do this?""."

Even when it is true that you will find a lot of non-USA delivery Land Cruisers for sale; it is also true that not only non-USA delivery Land Cruisers don’t meet US standards, but parts are difficult to find.The body was removed from the frame and the motor was serviced along with the transmission and brake system. Master cylinder, slave cylinder, brake disks, brake drums, and window seals were also replaced, all gauges were fully restored and serviced as well. All glass windows were fully polished, and all exterior bolts are stainless steel. I have made the decision to keep the original color and the classic pinstripes.

726,"Budget constrained fish meal@Fatty Tiger Restaurant, Puchong
Demona: The images of rows and rows of fishes on this gigantic banner hanging outside the restaurant was definitely an eye catcher to anyone who passes by. So much so that even if you were standing on the other end of the lot, you could still faintly see it.
However, it wasn’t the fishes which caught much of our attention. Instead, it was the two digit number that was printed next to the fishes, the beautiful number of 1 2 and the two alphabets before them, R M.
RM 12/ one full fish woey.!?
We could hardly believe our eyes. Well at least, for KL’s price of fishes, that is.
Demona: Fatty Tiger was fairly packed, so we proceeded upstairs. Biz looked good for the taukehs here as several tables were occupied upstairs as well. The menu boasts of a huge range of river rishes, which a frog-under-the-coconut-shell person like myself, wouldn’t know how to differentiate except some obvious difference in shapes and sizes between the several few.
Some fishes had golden bar price tags, potentially costing a mere fish head alone to be several hundred bucks (WOW!)
We hunted for the RM12/fish but couldn’t spot it on the menu. The waitress came up and explained to us that there was such a fish at such a price. These particular riverfishes are reared by the taukeh and sold at a real good deal price, and they do not make much profit out of this. Instead, their profit targets are more on the higher end river rishes eg: the golden price tag fishes.
Demona: Poor RM 12 river fish, you. Fed to the right size, and scooped right out of its pond and in it went, into a pack of ice, waiting to be served fresh to the next customer…… US.
Demona: Sorry, fishy fish. You were the chosen one to serve us. Cooked assam nyonya style. Initially, the sauce was really spicy and sour, yet at the end palate, the sweetness of the pineapples showed up. The fish meat was fairly fresh. We had this fish, cooked plain steamed before, and my gf who joined in the dinner mentioned that there was a slight muddy taste to it but thankfully, wasn’t obvious enough to put you off eating it further. With the assam nyonya paste, the mud taste was of course, covered.
Anyhow, in usual circumstances, almost all self reared riverfishes couldn’t run too far from having the distinct muddy taste to their meat as they have less room to freely swim about, unlike their wild river fish brothers.
Demona: Dogma ordered a Dried Chillis Fried Chicken rice to eat along with the fish. The chicken meat was quite tender, with a nice fragrant aroma of ginger, onions and dried chillies absorbed into the meat. Deliciouso! As for me, the usual rice skipper…. I also stole half of Dogma’s chicken slices away. Grrrrrrrrrr.
I’m guessing the owner will shake his head whenever he sees people like us coming in, as we chose the cheapes fish, and ate the least (some more share meal!). If there are more of us diners coming in, the restaurant’s profit margin’s going to decline drastically.
On the contrary, the owner came up to us instead, with a big sincere smile, explaining to us about the fish which we ate, as well as the other fishes that he was selling, and even brought those expensive dead fishes on a tray, just to show us. He did subtly mentioned that the profit earnings for the RM12/fish was not much but that did not affect him severely as this strategy also earned him more happy return customers who potentially have golden goose pockets, and willing to explore more than just the RM12/fish deal.
This is one restaurant that we shall always come to whenever we feel like having good olde’ fish meat to eat and not having to burn our wallets too much.",What is the strategy of the Fatty Tiger Restaurant for attracting customers and making profit?,"The Fatty Tiger Restaurant attracts customers by offering a full fish meal for RM 12.

328,"In the past, any review I've done has had the nickname 'Lit review' in front of it, and science's version of Literature has nothing to do with fiction. Hopefully, Cannonball reviews won't need referencing, because, embarrassing but true, I'm no good at EndNote.
So, before November 1st, I thought I'd sneak in some practice. Just in case it turns out that I need to learn that fucking program afterall.
I bought this book because I was due to treat a group of mice via a nebuliser for an hour, and watching them bathe in the mist gets really boring after two minutes. It's a lot better than most of the stuff I do to them, but it's still boring. I read most of it in that hour, then finished it in my lunchbreak. I'm a latecomer to Agatha Christie and Arthur Conan Doyle, which makes me some kind of heretic amongst bookworms, but I'm going to make up for lost time, 'kay?
And Then There Was None is a classic 'strangers with secrets trapped in a house with a killer' story. I'd wager that it was this book that made it a classic storyline. Ten people are brought to an island via mysterious means, and trapped there by U.N. Owen ('Unknown'), who's got a burning desire to lay down some vigilant justice. Each of them are responsible for the death of another person. Some directly, some indirectly, and all of them exonerated by the law or society.
One by one, they're killed off, the manner scripted by a poem framed in each of their rooms ('Ten little soldiers', a variation on Ten little Indians). They quickly realise the killer is one of them, though they've got no idea who. The story moves fast, dragging the reader along with it, until the inevitable conclusion. Because it's a mystery, I won't give away the ending, but it's good. It's very good. Christie has a gift for sketching characters while keeping them utterly believable, so you don't end up screaming at the pages 'Oh for fuck's sake, why are you so stupid?!'. I found Emily Brent, the ultra-religious bitch, particularly interesting, and I found myself wishing she'd died a little later; that perhaps she might have then been introduced to an entirely different kind of Revelation.
If there's any problem with reading 'classics' it's that the plot has inevitably been diluted by repeated retellings by people who've clearly decided that, since the plot has already been figured out, they better focus on cheap tricks to keep the reader/viewer interested (I'm looking at you, Saw, but I'll give you a pass, Clue). The originals are still brilliant, but I always feel like both the author and I have been ripped off. The author, because, well, they've been ripped off, and me, selfishly, because I'm missing out on some of the sheer joy that comes with a good, original, storyline.
I discovered a bit of the history of this book, and I hesitated before mentioning it, but chances are good someone else will anyway. The bookcover claims it was originally published as 'Ten Little Indians', but, according to Wiki, the first title was actually 'Ten little Niggers', and the poem and name of the island reflected that (in the version I have, it's soldier island). I read that some people believe that Christie was using the predjudices of the time to convey just how 'separate' the island was, and play into the fears we're given in childhood. Personally, I don't think the story has suffered at all for the changes, and, whatever deeper meaning Christie was trying to convey, it's no longer relevant. Of course Christie may have possessed those same predjudices, but somehow, I doubt it. (Mind you, I'm basing that on a very small amount of evidence).
I just thought I'd better add, in case my countries recent stupidity with that Blackface skit gives anybody the wrong idea: there's no way in hell I want to see the original title in a bookstore.
oh no! that was too good.
there's no way mine will be gooder than that!
my nerves are SHOT.
everyone is going to laugh at me and point and, you know, pig's blood.
well, i hope YOU're happy. your practice run is so successful it's driving me iNsAnE.
Well YOU've made me blush, and I haven't done that since I got a back massage from a lovely chinese gentleman and there were some wacky language barriers and I'm STILL not sure if I was meant to take my shirt off or not. At least this is a happy blush.
I promise not to point OR laugh at your reviews.

954,"Comment from eLoran Technologies staff:
The big question today ‘’who invented the internet’, notwithstanding Al Gore’s claim, there is no question of who invented the ‘solid state’ Loran transmitter, at its core the innovative ‘magnetic (Loran) pulse (forming and shopping) compression technology. Dr Paul Johannessen founded the company Megapulse (1970) to exploit the technology breakthrough and apply it to the network of legacy ‘tube type’ Loran transmitters. After thorough vetting and exhaustive validation tests, 4 years in the making, the technology was approved (1974) as the technology of choice under a USCG initiative and modernization program; and mandate to provide Loran coverage and with it PNT services to the US maritime and timing communities. The mandate extended to GA with the closure of the mid continent (Loran) gap in 1986. Clearly, Paul’s achievements rest on the prior work of other, that had its beginning at the newly formed MIT radiation Lab in 1940, and recognized as a major (one of four) milestone at a recent (June 2012) IEEE Milestone in Electrical Engineering and computing awards presentation by the IEEE Boston chapter. Nevertheless Paul’s unique achievements, in the process of discovery and invention, was a major contribution to the development of a stable and reliable National Loran Network, in the US; and worldwide. Paul’s fertile mind extended the vision and applied the necessary resources to develop and to make the Loran network the terrestrial equivalent of GPS or as a backup absent GPS. Erik Johannessen, President of Megapulse accepted the honors on behalf of the Loran communities, provided the historical context in the development of the technology and spoke of the splendid collaborative effort of the many to deliver important (new) capabilities in the design and development of the ‘next generation’ eLoran PNT&C equipment and services to make Paul’s vision reality.

And posing.
As you can probably tell, we had a lot of snow overnight. The drifts were a foot deep in places (which is quite a lot for us). After dinner, I went to the fields to check up on the lamb. Their field has a lot of gorse bushes at one end, next to a large wall. At the lower end (it’s a steep hill), there’s a wall and then a road, but no gorse, so they wold be easy to spot. No such luck. I walked along the gorse at the top of the field, following the footprints in the snow. There was no sign of them. As I was headed back to the gate however, I spotted this:
It was mother ewe, and where she was, her lamb was sure to follow.
Thank goodness they were OK. They must have been in the gorse for most of the night, but at least they were safe. You could even say that they were lucky.
So, Lucky it is then.
This is the view from the top of their field.
The Mournes was one of the worst areas hit by the snow. Just look at Newcastle’s harbour.
Ben was thrilled to have the snow back.
You can tell by his face, no?
Thankfully, some of the ewes are inside out of the snow (sorry for the terrible photo – not much light in there).
And did I mention, this has been the worst snow for over 25 years?
Yeah, Pip’s glad of her home comforts now.
And for those of you who are interested, this is how I got the snow effect on my photos: A Simple Snow Effect Widget for Blogger Blogs.

It's a good thing Little Pip is growing so fast otherwise she might have gotten lost in that snow. I am so happy the mother and baby lamb are OK. My heart dropped when you said you couldn't see them. Do they just not like the barn?
You sure live in a beautiful place! My views are not so pretty, trust me!
Your pal, BIG Pip
lucky lamb indeed!
ben looks so, so thrilled about all the snow lol
So glad Lucky and his mama are OK. What a beautiful countryside.

1094,"Orchard Cottage
Orchard Cottage is an idyllic and wonderfully situated little cottage, with its wisteria-clad stone gables at the front, thatched roof and pretty façade
SLEEPS: 6 Adults + 2 kids
BEDROOMS: 4
BATHROOMS: 3
OVERVIEW
Orchard Cottage is beautiful grade II listed house on the private drive to Dillington House.
Inside it has been recently renovated to a high standard. There are three main bedrooms, one loft bedroom, and three bathrooms. One of the bedrooms is on the ground floor, allowing easy access for those less able to cope with stairs (however there are one or two steps on the ground floor).
The cottage has an open plan kitchen / dining room that is well equipped for those who enjoy cooking, and the dining table seats 10. There is a separate utility with washing facilities next door to the kitchen and a separate library / study area off the dining area. Next door is a spacious living room with a wood-burning stove, large flatscreen TV and comfy sofas.
The house also has a garden, with a protected and well-lit outdoor dining area (right outside the kitchen), and a wood-fired hot-tub in the garden. There is private parking for three cars.
The house’s rural location makes it a great escape for those looking to spend some time in the countryside, with plenty of pubs to walk / cycle to and things to see and do nearby, and convenient shopping in Ilminster is not far away.
BEDROOMS
There are three main bedrooms and one loft room, all with deep mattresses, 400 thread count cotton bedding, indulgent mattress toppers and indulgent fluffy bathrobes.
The ground floor bedroom has a superking-sized bed that can be separated into two singles and its own wet-room shower room. This room is a lovely room for anyone, but is especially well suited to those less able to navigate stairs, although there are two internal stairs on the ground floor so access is not entirely step-free.
In the two main bedrooms upstairs, the first has a superking-sized double turned leg four-poster, and a bathroom with a beautiful freestanding nickel bath (as well as walk-in shower), the second can be arranged as superking-sized double or with twin singles and has a walk-in shower only.
The fourth bedroom is a twin and is accessed only through the four-poster bedroom mentioned above, with which it also shares a bathroom, and so together these two rooms are ideally suited to a family with children.
LIVING AREAS
The kitchen / dining room is well equipped with an induction hob, oven, and there is a large fridge freezer with ice-machine in the nearby utility / larder. The dining table can seat 10 comfortably. The house also has a washer-dry. There is also a little library / study area for reading – or anyone who really must work!
And there is a good-sized lawn with a wood-fired hot-tub, a charcoal bbq and a teak outdoor table with chairs in a sheltered sunken patio area directly outside the kitchen.
SETTING & LOCAL AREA
Orchard Cottage is situated on the private drive to Dillington House, which is 100 metres or so further along the drive.
As well as being a quiet road, the drive to Dillington House is a bridleway and footpath. It leads into Dillington Park, which is a large area of parkland ideal for walks and dogs, and onto a myriad of other walking and cycling routes.
Nearby there are several pubs, such as the Dinnington Docks, Lord Poulett Arms, or Five Dials. couldn’t imagine the cottage being as lovely as it was, it way exceeded our expectations!
The quality of fixtures and fittings, furniture etc were all excellent, and made cooking in the kitchen a pleasure!
The place was spotlessly clean and had absolutely everything we needed to enjoy a relaxing weekend away.
The bath also proved to be very popular – there was a queue to use it!!

The victim then picked Thomas Lee Carr out of a photo lineup as her assailant.
He is charged with attempted rape.
The woman said on Tuesday just before noon she was followed into the complex where she lives by a white male wearing a blue tank top and dark-colored pants.
She said he followed her up to the second floor, then forced his way into her room.
The woman said he then tried to take off her clothes while dropping his own pants. She said he tried to force her head down towards his crotch.
She said the man fled when a roommate entered the room.
After multiple outlets, including Chattanoogan.com, ran the photo that was taken off the complex's video camera, callers all said it was ""Tom.""
Police said, ""They all stated they work with him at Amazon and they were adamant that was the individual.""

1005,"On Tuesday, Maduro proposed to the opposition the signing of an agreement that would bind both sides to recognize and respect the results of the December 6 parliamentary elections, no matter what the result. Maduro announced the proposal by saying:
I think the time has come for the Electoral Power to issue a document, and I as chief of state will speak on behalf of all patriotic, Bolivarian, chavista, revolutionary, socialist forces. We are willing to sign it whenever, right now, to recognize the results of the December 6 elections, whatever they may be.
The proposal was met with skepticism from the opposition. The head of the Mesa de la Unidad Democratica (MUD) – the official opposition bloc – Jesus Torrealba, said that it did not make sense to sign an agreement with someone “whose word means nothing”. Instead of an essentially meaningless show as is the signing of the document, Torrealba suggested that the government instead agree to more concrete steps to guarantee the fairness of the elections, including:
- Allowing international observers from the Organization of American States and the European Union.
- Barring PSUV candidates from using state money to run their campaigns.
- Suspending cadenas [government broadcasts that all radio and television stations must show in their entirety whenever they are called] until the election.
- Allowing all candidates equal access to radio airwaves.
Enrique Naime, an electoral expert, told El Nacional that signing an agreement to respect election results is secondary to respecting the way the elections are held:
Historically, in electoral processes, documents are signed to respect the electoral process, not the results, because they are a consequence of a process.
Naima echoed Torrealba’s suggestions and proposed eight key points to ensure the elections are conducted fairly, including allowing for the presence of national and international observers.
Cabello: Opposition Will Receive “Beating” on December 6
National Assembly President Diosdado Cabello spoke at an event yesterday in Carabobo state on the December 6 Parliamentary elections. He said:
We are going to win, and we are going to give them a beating. They think that the people – which might have reason to be upset – will come out and vote for an escualido [derogatory term for opposition member]. That will never happen. Chavistas have conscience, and no matter what happens they will go along with the Bolivarian project and Commander Chavez.
Cabello also said that the opposition “will never again govern Bolivar’s land”, and said that the opposition’s goal was not to win the election, but to:
… bring back the disaster that was the Fourth Republic [the political period before Chavez came to power], the assassinations, the parapolicias [this literally means, “paramilitary police”, but I think it’s akin to “hit squad”].
AG: Rosales Will Be Arrested Immediately Upon Return
Former Zulia governor and presidential candidate Manuel Rosales has been living in self-exile since 2009. At that time, he stood accused of corruption, a charge he dismissed as political. On Friday, Rosales announced that he would finally return to Venezuela “with evidence to prove the confabulation” that forced him to free the country.
Speaking from a secret location – widely believed to be somewhere in Peru – Rosales said:
We’ll meet again in the Chinita airport [in Zulia state] on Thursday, October 15. I’ll be stepping on Venezuelan soil in turbulent times, against threats and everything, because this struggle is for the people, for history, and for the Venezuelan homeland.
Today, Attorney General Luisa Ortega Diaz was straightforward with her assessment of Rosales’ return;
There is an arrest warrant out for Manuel Rosales, so he will be arrested when he enters Venezuela.

Am Fam Physician. 2007 May 15;75(10):1428.
The challenge of editing articles for American Family Physician is to combine a thorough knowledge of medicine with skillful wordsmithing. To meet this challenge, medical and professional editors work collaboratively to guide articles from submission to print, while ensuring the quality, accuracy, and usefulness of the content.
The medical editors, whose expertise is primarily in clinical and academic medicine, also possess the ability to express their medical knowledge in writing. You can see more information about the medical editors in the May 1, May 15, and June 1, 2006, issues of AFP. The professional editors, whose expertise lies in communicating information, help to improve the organization, presentation, and language of clinical articles. The discipline of editing for these professional editors entails knowing medical terminology and medical style (through resources such as the American Medical Association Manual of Style), learning the names and indications of drugs, and staying current on developments in the field of medicine.
The Editing Process
An AFP manuscript passes first through the hands of a medical editor, who focuses on medical content only, not journalistic or stylistic considerations. After peer review, author revisions, and final acceptance, the articles are sent to the professional editors who perform an extensive edit to ensure the content is correct and adheres to AFP style, verify references and drug names, obtain proper permissions, and check for grammatical and content accuracy. Working with authors and medical editors, these editors shape manuscripts into the well-crafted articles that are published in AFP.
In addition, the professional editors are responsible for coordinating various regular departments in AFP, some of which they write themselves. Coordination responsibilities include scheduling, collaborating with medical editors and authors, editing, and final proofing. Departments written by the professional editors and reviewed by the medical editors include Practice Guidelines and Practice Guideline Briefs, Quantum Sufficit, Inside AFP, and Newsletter, which is written in collaboration with the AAFP Communications department.
The “Business” Aspects
As if all of this were not enough, the professional editors are responsible for much of the administrative work involved with publishing, such as tracking illustrations for articles and patient education handouts, manuscript tracking and reporting, requesting permissions for reprints of figures or tables, coordination with the Continuing Medical Education division of the Academy, accounting and budgeting issues, and, of course, other duties as assigned.
The current AFP staff includes 11 professional editors. These editors bring a total of 136 years of professional journalism experience to AFP; 97 of those years have been specifically related to medical editing. Their time with AFP varies from one to 10 years. This creates a nice balance between those with a long tenure who know the history of AFP and the newer staff members who bring a fresh perspective to the journal.

The best of 2012 was certainly the post about a rather funny Starbucks logo that went viral over StumbleUpon just a couple of hours after being published and brought more than 20,000 visits alone. That was really surprising! On the other hand, a post that has been consistently popular throughout the year is the one with logos from the Olympic Games, but considering the London 2012 Olympic games, that turned out to be a pretty obvious result.
Surely this year was not limited just by the two articles I mentioned above. Many other posts were very popular, here’s a list of what people most read on my blogs during 2012:
- Modern Vintage Logo Design Inspiration
- Evolution of the Batman Logo by Rodrigo Rojas
- Microsoft Windows 8 New Logo Design
- Free Logo Vectors from Women Magazines
- Doctor Who Logo History
- 10 Fantastic Fonts for Bold Memorable Logos
- 5-year-old Analyses Logos
- The Logo that Should Have Been Stumbled Upon
- How to Organise Your Design Project Folders
It has been a great blogging year, not only because of the sheer amount of visitors I welcomed in my blogs, but also because writing so much is proving to be the best exercise to better my understanding of English grammar. I cannot avoid rolling my eyes whenever I read my old posts, and I’m sure you would too, but the dichotomy between my current and past writing also serves to show that all one needs to write well is to write a lot.
I’m sure I still make a lot of silly mistakes, but I feel much more comfortable with a keyboard than last year. So, following a yearly tradition of classifying my own writing skills, I think this year I’m going with bread-and-butter. Not much, but a big improvement from last year’s outrageously-bad. Woohoo! Way to go me! :)
Actually, this is the first year that I’ve felt confident enough to not use a very demeaning adjective in my classification system. I’m sure I must thank WoordUp for that, a variety blog where I write daily about anything that get my attention during the day. I wrote 647 articles there this year, that’s a lot of practice! If you want to learn how to write, the best advice I can give is to start a daily blog! Practice my friend, as if there is no tomorrow!
With all of that said, the icing on the blogging cake this year was being invited to write for WebDesigner Depot, a blog that I’ve been reading long before I’ve started to think about writing my own. I felt truly honored and it has been a pleasure to reach out to so many of you, who started to read my blog after finding my posts there. If you haven’t read those yet, I must ask you to check this page, it contains links to the posts I wrote for them.
I guess that’s it. Oh no, wait, I almost forget to talk about Logoness
First and foremost, Logoness is a vector logo library I started earlier this year. I’ve been personally checking the quality of hundreds of vectorized logos and uploading them one by one to build the best high-quality logo library of the web. If you ever need a vector logo, feel free to use Logoness, and please let me know what you think of it. I would love your feedback.
But that’s not all, I’ve moved all of my logo related posts there, and I must admit that I’m not sure where that blog is going yet, but the truth is that I would love to find a few collaborators to write about logo design there in the upcoming year. So, just in case, if you are reading this, and would like to get your name out there writing for a new super-duper logo blog, please, by all means, get in touch. If you think your English is not good enough, don’t worry, everyone needs to start somewhere, perhaps I can help you with that.
Well, that’s all folks. Thanks for reading and Happy New Year! :)",What was the most surprising post on the blog in 2012?,"The most surprising post of 2012 was about a funny Starbucks logo that went viral over StumbleUpon just a couple of hours after being published and brought more than 20,000 visits alone."
1466,"The past - case law, legal precedent and prior decisions - is usually a critical element of Supreme Court deliberations. But last week’s oral arguments on President Obama’s health care law indicate this court’s nine justices are focused on another factor altogether: the future.
The Obama administration and other backers of the Affordable Care Act went into the arguments confident the law would be upheld if the justices followed the precedents they and their predecessors had set over the past 70 years of jurisprudence.
But during the final two days of arguments, the justices barely mentioned previous cases, spending time instead mulling hypothetical situations in attempts to determine where the law’s constitutional limits are drawn.
“What I saw … was five justices who took off their chains,” said Ian Millhiser, a policy analyst for the liberalCenter for American Progress. “That’s scary whether you like the opinion they wind up writing or you don’t, because it means that the next time around they’ll be free to take the chains off again.”
In the briefs it submitted defending the law, the Obama administration repeatedly pointed to landmark Commerce Clause cases such as Wickard v. Filburn and Gonzales v. Raich to remind the court it already has allowed the government to regulate activities closely related to interstate commerce.
Meanwhile, those challenging the law pointed to two outlying cases in 1995 and 2000 when the court found limits to Congress’ power under the Commerce Clause, and struck down two laws as unconstitutional.
But instead of talking about how those cases inform the decision they face now, Republican-appointed justices Samuel A. Alito Jr., Antonin Scalia and Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. peppered Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. with questions such as why the government couldn’t also force people to buy cellphones, cars or broccoli, if it can make them buy health insurance.
“So can the government require you to buy a cellphone because that would facilitate responding when you need emergency services?” Chief Justice Roberts said. “You can just dial 911 no matter where you are?”
And Justice Alito pushed Mr. Verrilli to explain the difference between mandating health insurance and burial insurance. “Most people are going to need health care,” he said. “Almost everybody. Everybody is going to be buried or cremated at some point. What’s the difference?”
The tenor and intensity of their questions left the administration and supporters of the law reeling and wondering whether the court will do an about-face on Commerce Clause jurisprudence.
Mr. Millhiser called the potential scenario “shocking and terrifying.”
“If the justices start acting like every single case is a blank slate they can do whatever they want with, then my law degree isn’t worth very much,” he said. “But beyond that it has terrifying implications for the country.”
Court-watchers said the challengers, and not the administration, seemed to set the terms of the debate, as the justices pushed the administration to offer a “limiting principle” - an example of something the government can’t do if it can mandate insurance.
“I think this demonstrates that the plaintiffs have been very successful in framing the case for the justices as ‘this is something that is unprecedented, this is a major step, it has all kinds of ramifications in the future,’ ” said Tim Jost, a Washington and Lee University law professor who supports the individual mandate.
Even moderate Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, a typical swing vote on the court, suggested to Mr. Verrilli that he has a weighty burden to prove the government can require Americans to buy insurance without violating the Constitution - although he also seemed to agree with the administration that the health care market is unique from other types of markets.",What was the main concern of the Supreme Court justices during the oral arguments on President Obama's health care law?,The main concern of the Supreme Court justices during the oral arguments on President Obama's health care law was the future implications of the law and where its constitutional limits are drawn.

Pretty cool. Like a good backstory for a magic item that can be very useful to a group...or to a village.Go to Comment!!
There is still something to be said about aged meat, but this will definitely do...oh, yes, it will do.?
- Those that believe in the curse to the depth of their bones go out and assassinate or kill 2024 people anyway regardless of the king's intention. So even if they king protects his subject from that fate, those that believe and fear the curse will simply go on a killing spree to fulfill the need.
Now he has to decide to I continue the custom and spare the innocent citizens or fight those that would defy his decision.
Awesome. I like it because there is so much you can do with it. You have a benevolent ruler that does it as a matter of course or you can get a bastard (in the attitude sense, not the offspring) that brings the torture and defilement into the main city.
Then there are so many little plots and twists you can throw around that could have as wide reaching reprecussions as you want. If they don't sacrifice then anything that happens in the world against the kingdom can be tagged part of the curse.
(can't stop)
- Because the king stopped the killings, many small villages that are deeply superstitious start blaming any misfortune on the lack of sacrifice. This leads to an almost religous zeal backing the belief. Slowly, through self-induced hysteria they may start killing their own criminals or lynching those that are only accused of crimes in order to alleviate their own personal misfortune. All it takes is a drought ""cured"" by a killing to provide ""proof"" that it works and soon the entire countryside is deep in their own version of 2024.
-- King decides that following the decision is better than this outcome and follows through with the sacrifice. Now he needs to get word through the kingdaom. Will the believe it? Will it be enough to stop what has already begun?
--PCs could have witnessed the fixed sacrifice and be charged with bringing this word, or carry it as they adventure because they want to stop the killing. Each time they come to a village would bring possible conflict. They villages might believe their word or call them liars. A new tension and moral dilemna for the players to have decide whenever they see an injustice based on the sacrifices.
I like it, but I too want more. As soon as you throw dragons into the mix (and other uber strong monsters) we want, nay...need more background. Even if your intention is just a vague story to be adapted and absorbed into other campaigns, we want to hear your take on it. Gives the idea that much more creedance and understanding on your intentions.
For this, I am begging the question....why? With that alone I would be satisfied I think! Why is he being chased, why do they find him anywhere they go, why isn't there TONS of rumors about the path of dragon destruction that always happens after this dude shows up. Dude would be lynched upon arriving at any town way before the dragons get there...and there might be a reason he isn't.
This is on the edge of greatness...push it over the edge!.

I woke up to the smell of burning flesh. I open my eyes to the wake of destruction that even generations yet unborn would cry out in anguish. Ser Alan himself was a victim of circumstance. Our companionship may have been short-lived but he will live on in memory. Left with but an ounce of energy, I persistently moved on and was able to reach the Regal Opera Houses in Stratford in time to have an immediate audience with the king.
William: I see you’ve already made quick use of what was left of your talents with the sigil of Tesco.
The king was a flambouyant man and one could easily question his sexuality, but none have ever had the audacity to confront him about it.
Rupert: Yes, Your Highness. But I only did what was necessary.
William: We could have used it. But very well, let’s just carry on. I believe you have something to impart.
Rupert: I bring to you the prophecy of Verwirrung.
William: Speak.
[VERWIRRUNG]",What is the sigil of Tesco used for according to Rupert?,"The sigil of Tesco is used to harness one’s inner potentials. In order to release that insurmountable power held within, one must sacrifice and embrace the decimation of life around them."

Why It Doesn't Matter Whether You Like 'Community' -- or Tons of Other NBC Shows
The reason I've written in the past that NBC chairman Bob Greenblatt deserves to gloat about the network's dramatic rise to No. 1 from No. 4 is very simple: In this day and age, running a broadcast network is extremely difficult, and exactly how you climb out of the muck -- NFL games, riding a big singing show like The Voice, getting lucky here and there -- doesn't matter. You did it. And it was damned hard.
It also was written to be fair. Every network president eventually will stumble and be questioned or criticized. And these days Greenblatt must be looking at his assembled series and muttering the Tina Fey as Liz Lemon proclamation: ""What the what?""
STORY: 'Community' Bosses Address Chevy Chase's Exit, Post-Dan Harmon Changes and Why Netflix Reigns
Because NBC has tumbled back down to earth -- or under it, depending how you look at it. The ratings are gone. New shows have flopped; Deception and Do No Harm were not only lousy dramas but spurned by viewers. Worse for Greenblatt -- because it's his pet show -- Tuesday's second-season return of Smash hit the earth like a wayward meteor, down 71 percent in the demo from its series premiere and 39 percent from its season one finale.
That's why the word ""repudiate"" is in the dictionary.
Hell, Do No Harm went below Rock Center numbers, which is really saying something. Even Go On, a modest hit that's basically Community in a more broadly palatable form, is bleeding viewers. One of NBC's biggest fall success stories was Revolution, but it doesn't return until March 25 and will have been off the air for nearly four months -- which, for a serialized show, is really testing viewer loyalty.
And now Community returns, the first episode from its new showrunners after Dan Harmon was relieved of his duties -- running the show he created. For a brilliant little series with a very small but loyal fan base, the switch at the helm and NBC's constant pushing back of the premiere has led to little flares of anxiety and exasperation on the Internet. The buildup of online chatter as Community returns Thursday night has been impressive for a cult show.
PHOTOS: 'Community' Season 4 Premiere First Look
Look, I happen to love Community. But it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if you hate the new direction. It doesn't matter if you're pleasantly surprised that you can't really tell the difference. It doesn't even matter if you're just happy it's back.
Because it's dead. You must have known that. And if not, here's your reminder: Community is dead.
NBC has much, much bigger worries than Community, a series it essentially gave up on long ago. (If you want to see a similar pattern of network behavior, look into the ABC/Cougar Town archives and see how that ended.) No doubt the first thing Greenblatt is looking at with a certain panic are those Smash numbers. It's like the poster series for ""hate watching"" couldn't even generate that crowd to watch. Was Tuesday's premiere some weird aberration? If the numbers stay in nadir territory -- or worse -- Greenblatt will have his toughest decision as a broadcast network chief. On cable, where Greenblatt rose to prominence at Showtime, you can nurture the little ponies. At the network level, you're running horses. And if they don't win?
Bang! Glue.
This is the decision that will haunt and/or define Greenblatt. If Smash truly implodes, will he dump it and continue searching for a hit? Or will he take up a precious hour on the schedule for a show that can't be saved?
STORY: Why Even DVR Won't Save 'Smash' Ratings
See, NBC needs to overhaul its lineup. No tinkering. No patience. Before the upfronts in May, it's spring cleaning time in Burbank. Do No Harm and Deception will be gone, as will Community, the retiring-past-its-sell-by-date Office, the wretched Guys With Kids (one would hope). Already 30 Rock has had its swan song. Outside of The Voice and NFL games, what's truly untouchable on the NBC schedule? If you went from fourth to first and back to fourth again, you'd do some soul searching. And one would assume that soul searching would lead to, ""We need to blow it up.""
Personally, I love Parks and Recreation -- it's one of my favorite shows, and I hope it stays on forever. I also like 1600 Penn, Grimm and Parenthood. But those are not exactly hits, so there's worry.
Chicago Fire is not a show I'd watch regularly, but it does what it was designed for, and NBC needs to stay in the procedural game. Despite the star power in the sitcom Up All Night, the viewers never came, and NBC's decision to switch to a multicamera format with a live audience is a little bit like the crying doctor who keeps trying to resuscitate a patient who has flat-lined. Whitney and The New Normal? Betty White's Off Their Rockers? These are not keepers, people. These aren't shows that redirect a network skyward.
Dateline? The Celebrity Apprentice? The Biggest Loser? A little long in the tooth.
So, yes, enjoy Community tonight (or not). Pretend it's a wake. There's a reversal of course coming to NBC, and the only show to monitor for clues about how deep the cuts are going to be is Smash.

419,"If this wasn’t a WTF moment in art history then I don’t know what was.
Sick of playing by the rules, Picasso just went for it in Les Demoiselles d’Avignon (The Young Ladies of Avignon), and quite literally changed the face of painting as we knew it. Folks say this painting hails the advent of modern art, which is probably why it is one of the most visited painting at the MoMA.
These odd looking ladies stare out at us from a brothel window in a very “whatchu lookin’ at?” kind of way. The frank, direct gaze of Manet’s Olympia and how she makes the viewer uncomfortable may have inspired Picasso, but these prostitutes make Olympia look run of the mill. The art world was shocked by Picasso’s total dismissal of those little things taught in art school like perspective, anatomy, scale, yadda-yadda-yadda. But for real, what is going on in this painting? Is that woman on the right peeking out of curtains behind everyone else or on the same visual plane? Are the two figures in the center standing up or lying down? And I can’t even start with the squatting figure that looks like she's doing her best The Excorcist impression.
Before this painting, Picasso was stuck in his Rose period and playing it quite safe. And then suddenly – there was this. It was like shards of glass had exploded all over the canvas and left these jagged ladies behind. Originally, in the sketches, there was a man holding a book in the painting too, but he was left out of the final composition. And a good thing, too. Because girl power is going strong here. Even though the ladies look like they’re posing in the display case of a shop window, they seem completely unapologetic. They appear unaware of the fact that their faces are nothing like the ones you’d see on earlier nudes. They’re just not pretty. In fact, Picasso drew inspiration from Iberian and African masks he’d seen at an exhibition at the Louvre, something that is pretty obvious when you look at both the chicks on the right. Other inspirations: Matisse, Gauguin, El Greco, and Cezanne.
One of the curators from the MoMA talks about how Picasso was afraid of contracting syphilis from these working girls, whose faces might be showing some symptoms of the STD. And that apprehension may be reflected in the uneasiness that the viewer feels when these women stare back. Because, let’s not forget, the very first viewer was Picasso and it's his anxiety that we’re indirectly feeling. It also tells us that Picasso liked to party with hookers, but that shouldn't surprise anyone.
Like most famous artworks, everyone obviously hated this painting when they first saw it. His buddies Braque and Matisse thought it might be some kind of terrible joke, but were intrigued by it nonetheless. The painting was originally titled The Brothel of Avignon but was changed by the curator of the exhibition in which it first raised the publics’ eyebrows. It was bought for the close to nothing price of $24,000 by MoMA in 1937. They had to pawn a Degas to raise the money for this, but I’m guessing they got their money’s worth.
Here is what Wikipedia says about Les Demoiselles d'Avignon
Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (The Young Ladies of Avignon, originally titled The Brothel of Avignon) is a large oil painting created in 1907 by the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso. The work, part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, portrays five nude female prostitutes in a brothel on Calle de Avinyó, a street in Barcelona. Each figure is depicted in a disconcerting confrontational manner and none is conventionally feminine. The women appear slightly menacing and are rendered with angular and disjointed body shapes. The in fact, his subsequent friendship and collaboration with Picasso led to the cubist revolution. Its resemblance to Cézanne's The Bathers, Paul Gauguin's statue Oviri and El Greco's Opening of the Fifth Seal has been widely discussed by later critics.
At the time of its first exhibition in 1916, the painting was deemed immoral. The work, painted in Picasso's studio in the Bateau-Lavoir in Montmartre, Paris, was seen publicly for the first time at the Salon d'Antin in July 1916, at an exhibition organized by the poet André Salmon.. Picasso, who always referred to it as mon bordel (""my brothel""), or Le Bordel d'Avignon, never liked Salmon's title and would have instead preferred the bowdlerization Las chicas de Avignon (""The Girls of Avignon"").","What is the significance of Picasso's painting, Les Demoiselles d’Avignon, in the history of art?","Les Demoiselles d’Avignon is significant in the history of art as it is considered to have changed the face of painting and hailed the advent of modern art. Picasso dismissed traditional art school teachings like perspective, anatomy, and scale in this painting. The painting is also notable for its depiction of five nude female prostitutes in a confrontational manner, with angular and disjointed body shapes, inspired by Iberian and African masks."

I always enjoy your posts and photos. The family photo in front of the fireplace is exceptionally nice. Even the cat looks like he's posing.
The cat was so scared of the camera - even before we took the picture. It was Emma's idea to have him in the picture and Paul thought it would be hilarious.
We weren't brave enough for egg dying this year, mostly because I think Luke would have little interest and I'd end up doing all the eggs! Plus I don't eat hard boiled eggs. Next year. And having Luke hunt for eggs was a lot more challenging than I expected! He caught on that they had treats but was more interested in eating the few he did find than actually hunting for the rest. I finally made him find the remaining ones tonight! Looks like you had a great day together! I love Emma being a dinosaur in church. Hahaha.
The worst part about egg dying is having all the hard-boiled eggs leftover. I'm not big on them, but Paul's signature meal is an egg salad sandwich so he'll probably devour most of them. The kids have also suddenly started loving them - I think they just enjoy peeling them (which to me is the WORST part). I actually enjoy the relaxed egg hunts where the kids don't find all the eggs in under three minutes (like Matthew did this year). It's a lot more fun when it lasts a little longer! This time next year, both Luke and Emma will probably be egg hunting pros.",Who thought it would be hilarious to include the cat in the family photo?,Paul thought it would be hilarious to include the cat in the family photo.

836,"Monday Morning Manager 2011, Edition 9
This week: MIN (5/30-6/1); at CWS (6/3-5)
So, What Happened?
MMM looks at last week's record, sees 3-3, and shakes his head, because it didn't ""feel"" like a .500 week. It felt much, much worse.
Let's start with losing three straight to the Red Sox over the weekend, which only accentuated why MMM doesn't believe our Motor City Kitties are ready for prime time.
Then there was the strange Scott Sizemore trade, and the demotion of Ryan Perry and the handing of the 2B job to Ryan Freaking Raburn.
All that, and yet the Tigers played .500 for the week. Go figure.
The week began with a pair of victories over hot Tampa Bay, if you can remember that far back, because everything described above happened after the Rays left town.
The Tigers also lost an opportunity to gain ground on the Indians, who have lost four of five.
Hero of the Week
MMM is tempted to give the honor to young lefty Andy Oliver, who pitched well in his 2011 debut on Sunday.
But it's tough to go against Justin Verlander after what he did on Sunday night in the DH nightcap.
The Tigers were semi-reeling, looking like they were about to go off on another of those long losing streaks (it was at three and looking ominous) and be swept in four games at home to Boston, when Verlander came to the rescue.
JV shut the Bosox down, throwing a career-high 132 pitches and allowing zero, zip, nada runs.
He did what he had to do, when he had to do it---especially given the Tigers' popgun offense.
Anyone else want to argue that Max Scherzer, not JV, is the Tigers' ace?
Goat of the Week
MMM can't understand, nor stomach, manager Jim Leyland's stubbornness.
Why he continues to bat the consistent Jhonny Peralta and Alex Avila in the lower third of a batting order that is on life support is beyond MMM's comprehension.
MMM says top load the order with Austin Jackson, Peralta, Avila, Miggy Cabrera and Victor Martinez and see what happens.
Then Leyland declared that Raburn was his everyday second baseman on Friday night, and said the season for RR ""starts tomorrow.""
Well, on Opening Day, Raburn did his usual strikeout boogie, and ended Sunday's first game by being emasculated by Jonathan Papelbon on three pitches.
MMM is making Leyland the goat for his refusal to shake up a batting order that badly needs it.
MMM is tired of seeing the likes of Don Kelly and Andy Dirks (no offense, kid) in the two and three holes.
Under the Microscope
This week it's not a player, per se, who's UtM, but an entire position.
While you could make a case that that position ought to be 2B, MMM is putting 3B UtM.
This is because suddenly there's a pseudo platoon going on at the hot corner, with Brandon Inge and Kelly taking turns, against lefties and righties, respectively.
Inge told the media the other day, ""I think (sitting out the last two games) was a way to get me fired up and to bear down.""
After which Inge promptly went out and put on another couple of feeble offensive displays.
Neither Inge nor Kelly can hit. Kelly's RBI single late in Sunday's nightcap was just his THIRD ribbie of the season---and Don's been on the roster since Opening Day!!
Eyes should be trained on 2B, too, because there may be a trade a-comin'.
But for now, let's focus our attention on 3B and see what plays out there. Why? Because MMM is a masochist!
Upcoming: Twins and White Sox
The 17-34 Twins invade CoPa for three games. The Tigers must make sure the Twinkies leave town at least 18-36.
That's all MMM is going to say about that series. Nothing more needs to be said.
As for the White Sox, they've been showing some life lately, though they're still ""scuffling,"" as Rod Allen would say.
The Tigers, for whatever reason, have owned the Chisox in a winning streak over the South Siders that goes back to last season. MMM has lost track of how many games in a row the Tigers have won between the two teams, but it's a lot.
Will the streak continue through the upcoming weekend?
You'll never get MMM to put a bet down where the Tigers are concerned. They're more unpredictable than a woman choosing a pair of shoes.
That's all for this week's MMM. See you next week!

125,"Intuition is more than just a characteristic of highly sensitive people. For us, it is a cornerstone of our existence. It is the way we interpret life, how we learn, how we can become visionaries and how we pick up on the unspoken. In my experience, intuition can go so far as to being able to sense the type of off-screen relationship two actors have simply by watching their on-screen performances together, as well as being able to pick up on aspects of their off-screen personalities. Intuition can decipher what or who is behind the masks that are often used to conceal a piece of reality that doesn't want to be revealed.
Intuition isn't based on logical fact gathering, making it difficult to trust. A feeling that instantly makes itself known by permeating the soul, shrouded in an ambiguous cloud of realization, can be amazing and uncomfortable to handle. It’s amazing in the sense that you simply know things, almost instantly, without knowing how or why; uncomfortable in the sense that you're not sure you should trust just a feeling that seems to come from within.
There were many times when I second guessed that gut feeling, especially when it came to life decisions, other individuals' characters, motivations and intentions. After all, we're taught that the most important decisions in life should be based on facts, figures, what appears to be true, what will benefit us the most financially, and what seems to be the most logical. For sensitives, though, I think this approach can be an elusive trap that ignores our ability to sense, rather than dissect the answer.
The answer that logic leads you to can be diametrically opposed with the one that intuition gives us. I'm certainly not advocating that either approach should be abandoned in favor of the other, however, it’s been my experience that if your intuition is telling you ""no"" when logic is saying ""full speed ahead,"" you should stop and listen. Sometimes when you don't listen to intuition's ""no,"" it has a funny way of magnifying that ""no"" the entire time you're living with the manifestation of that decision.
Intuition instantly permeates through the masks that people use in an attempt to conceal their authentic selves, perceptions, motivations and intentions. It also sees through the politics that are played, which can make those that have perfected the illusion of a political persona very uncomfortable around you. The ability to sense what and who's beneath the surface helps you discover what people are unwilling to disclose openly. Intuition senses the soul, that inner essence full of past history, present existence and future aspirations. It is invaluable in discerning who can be trusted, how someone really feels about you, what that person wants, as well as the potential the relationship holds.
The ability to tune into the information that collective consciousness can bring us is also a part of intuition. Some call it the voice within, but I believe that those sudden whispers of premonition and insight come from the spiritual realm. Psychic ability is a heightened form of intuition that we all have the potential to develop and tune into. The difference for highly sensitives is that this potential comes already built in. It is automatic, as natural as breathing when its intended use is to help others, or prepare ourselves for events we otherwise wouldn't be able to handle properly without forewarning.
We don't want to think that a feeling, a sense of what is, can be as accurate as an analytical trail of puzzle pieces forming themselves into a conclusion. There's no explanation for ""just knowing"" or a method of how you arrived at the answer. Many things in this universe are inexplicable, but one can't deny the awe of their existence. When we begin to trust and believe in what doesn't seem to make sense, what can't be physically touched, we realize that reality begins with the invisible.
It's what goes on behind the scenes that brings the show to life. Why should you deny its validity?
Really awesome and insightful article. One of my favorites actually. I completely agree, and you bring up a lot of good points. I definitely can relate a lot of my own experiences to this.
Thanks! Glad you enjoy it. It's kind of scary how lucid this post is since it was only one month after my concussion. As for the rest of this blog....well, we'll see.
As a HSP, at times i've always felt that when feelings of a persons character that came out of nowhere were always false. i say this because i always thought that i was overreacting. because i would literally be living my life and then all of a sudden i get a feeling behind someones words or actions. My question to you is, is this my intuition or is it my HSP acting up and reading too far into it. and my other question would be, as HSP's how do we know when we are reading in too much on a certain subject or person? If you could email me at Motor-Spirit89@hotmail.com that would be great. any advice or tips would be GREATLY appreciated. i've learned to read subtleties but when it something or someone i like, i ALWAYS second guess it and either i end up looking like a fool or i miss my chance. :(
I feel the same way.. Did you ever get a reply?

1727,"So now I’m reading up on Hefazat-e-Islam. The Guardian had a useful piece on April 16.
It starts with tensions, clashes, religious conservatives versus more moderate, progressive voices.
The most recent development is the emergence of a radical conservative Muslim party, Hefazat-e-Islam, as the standard bearer of the religious right. Earlier this month, at a huge rally in Dhaka attended by more than 100,000 according to police, the party issued 13 demands. They included the introduction of measures to stop “alien culture” making inroads in Bangladesh, the reinstatement of the line “absolute trust and faith in the Almighty Allah” in the nation’s constitution, which is largely secular, and a ban on new statues in public places. not mix in public – seen by many as a bid to stop women working outside the home – that most worried Akhter, one of tens of millions of female labourers in Bangladesh’s booming garment industry.
“If we are not allowed to work, how will we survive?” asked Akhter, who supports her elderly parents on her monthly wage of 6,500 takas (£55). “Many of our coworkers were abandoned by their husbands. Some families only have daughters, whose parents are old. What will a single mother do? We will not have any means for a living.”
Well, you starve. So do your children, and so do your parents. Sorreee.
They explain that it’s all a misunderstanding though.
“The idea that Hefazat-e-Islam is taking the country back to the medieval age through its demands is propaganda,” said Moinuddin Ruhi, joint secretary of the party. “We are not opposing women’s development … Hefazat demands women refrain from free mixing in society to avoid sexual harassment and incidents such as rape. This does not … mean we want them to refrain from going to work or study. They should go to work and study following the principles of Islam.”…",What are some of the demands issued by the Hefazat-e-Islam party at a rally in Dhaka?,"The Hefazat-e-Islam party issued 13 demands at a rally in Dhaka.

The South Shore Breaker
It was a demonstration she had seen during Fire Prevention Week as an elementary school student that initially sparked Amber Barkhouse’s interest in becoming a volunteer firefighter with the Cornwall and District Fire Department in Lunenburg County.
“The chief who was there for a very long time, Johnny Yates, he put on Fire Prevention Week (activities) for years and he always made it interesting for kids and the first time I decided I wanted to be part of the fire department was when he brought his smoke machine in and put us in a small room and showed us how to be down low below the smoke if we were ever in a fire,” said Barkhouse in an interview.
Barkhouse comes from a family of volunteer firefighters. Her father has been a member of the Cornwall and District Fire Department for some 26 years and his two uncles were founding members of the department.
At 16, she officially joined the ranks and has since completed her medical first responders training and while she can’t enter burning buildings until she completes her level one fire training, Barkhouse “helps out the best I can” on fire calls.
Now 18 and graduated from Parkview Education Centre, Barkhouse has been recognized for her dedication to the fire service and the community. On Aug. 5, she was presented with the Canadian Volunteer Fire Service Association (CVFSA) Don McKee and Jim Hayter Memorial Scholarships. It was the first time both scholarships were presented to the same recipient.
“We’re pretty proud of her,” said retired fire chief Steve Patterson.
Barkhouse intends to pursue a career in enforcement as a fisheries officer. This fall she will be taking the Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC) fisheries program at the Shelburne Campus and after graduating there, plans to take a two-year wildlife conservation program at Holland College in P.E.I, and then she'll be off to Saskatchewan for her policing program.
Barkhouse has been working at the Northfield Poultry processing plant for the summer. In her free time, Barkhouse says she likes to go fishing, four wheeling and horseback riding.
“I’ve been riding since I was six,” she said. “I still ride at least once a week whenever I can get over to the barn (Red Pine Stables). It’s one of my free time resets.”
She also farms and grows meat birds.
“I like to be outside.”
Barkhouse was also involved in competitive Olympic style wrestling while in high school until COVID-19 hit. She holds the Nova Scotia Schools Athletic Federation (NSSAF) 2020 Senior Wrestling Championship title for 90kg.
Barkhouse was supposed to compete in the North American Indigenous Games this summer in Halifax, which was cancelled due to the pandemic. Where wrestling is a “close and personal” contact sport, when it makes a comeback remains to be seen, said Barkhouse.
Barkhouse recently took part in a question and answer session:

Reducing ship strikes to vulnerable whales
by International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW)
(Non-governmental organization (NGO))
Description
SDG 14 Targets Covered
Deliverables
Resources mobilized
There is a growing awareness of the worldwide problem of collisions between ships and whales. In some incidents there has been serious damage to the vessel and in most collisions a whale struck by a ship is killed or left severely injured. For some populations ship strikes are not only a welfare problem but also a conservation concern.
The International Whaling Commission (IWC) has identified the need to address the effects of ship strikes on cetaceans, and especially large whale populations, as a conservation concern worldwide. The IWC now has a ship strike strategy () and works with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) which developed guidance for reducing the risk of ship strikes with cetaceans in 2009 (MEPC.1/Circ.674). The IMO has recognised that that minor routeing changes in high risk areas could lead to substantial reduction in strikes and was possibly the best measure of reducing ship strikes (MEPC 69).
Currently, the only proven, effective mitigation measures to reduce ship strike risk are to avoid areas with known concentrations of whales, and in instances where this proves to be unfeasible, to reduce speed while transiting those areas. Such measures require the identification of high risk areas through detailed studies of patterns of whale and vessel distribution.
The IWC ship strike strategy contains a multi-stage process for addressing high ship strike risk areas. A number of high risk areas have already been identified. Some are at the stage where routeing options can be evaluated. In others, further research is needed to establish patterns of whale distribution to enable risk analyses for different routeing options or alternative risk reduction options, such as speed restrictions. In less well studied regions there are likely additional high risk areas that have not yet been identified.
The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and partners, working through the IWCs Scientific Committee, Conservation Committee and Ship Strikes Working Group, in partnership with other relevant international organizations, non-governmental organisations, industry and the scientific community, will advance the implementation of the IWCs ship strike strategy, with a particular focus on identifying high risk areas, and routeing options or other measures (such as speed restrictions) within these, that reduce collision risk in a way that causes minimum disruption to shipping.
Progress reports
12/2018
Input to the IWC Scientific Committee, Conservation Committee and Ship Strike Working Group on recommended courses of action for each high risk area described in the IWC Ship Strike Strateg, including actions to advance each situation forward at least one stage within a year (stages are outlined in the strategy).

Engagement with relevant international organisations (including IMO) to support the implementation of IWC recommendations, the delivery of the strategy and to respond to emerging ship strike issues.
12/2020
Engagement with shipping industry to build support for ship strike mitigation measures and their implementation in specific high risk areas.

This week is going to be pretty stellar in terms of comics. So many X-Books, the Miracleman reprint, Rat Queens, Velvet, Green Lantern Corps., and so many more! Check out what we’re reading after the jump!

All New X-Men! Amazing X-Men! Uncanny X-Men! Uncanny X-Force! X-Men Legacy! This is my kind of week! Even if Uncanny X-Force isn’t really doing it for me. I’m excited. I mean, I’m dropping Uncanny X-Force here pretty soon, so overall, this is a pretty stellar X-book week.
Marvel Knights Hulk piqued my interest with #1 and I’m all for sticking through to #4. This is going to be a very fun ride.
And, oh, Velvet. Brubaker. Epting. This title is everything a spy-thriller-mystery needs to be.
Daniel Palacio
- MIRACLEMAN #1
It’s finally back in print! After 20+ years of bitter rights disputes and legal wranglings, I’m thrilled that Marvel was able to get Miraclelman back in print. “The Original Writer” outdid himself when he turned a strip about a British Captain Marvel ripoff into one of the greatest superhero stories of all time (In my opinion, even better than Watchmen and every bit as good as his Swamp Thing run). My only worry is that Marvel will feel the need to edit out all of the sex and violence (a later issue features an extended and graphic depiction of childbirth).
Blake Hamilton
- Rat Queens #4
I am never fully ready when I’m only getting one thing for the week. Even with just getting one thing, I am happy to say it is Rat Queens! I am very glad I took a chance on this title as it has been nothing but a constant reward for me. Very excited to get the B cover variant to nearly fill out Rat Queen group members.
Jonathan Francois
- RAT QUEENS #4
For a series that I picked up on a whim, I’ve been nothing but please with Rat Queens. The series is certainly not for everyone, but it’s almost exactly what I want in a comic series (being violence, sassy dialogue, and a murderous comic relief character). It’s also the only series that’s made me care about collecting the variant covers.

Alex + Ada is a slow paced comic, but it has been holding my attention to a great degree. I’ve stated before that I’d love some of the tech in this comic so I could become more of a hermit.
It has been revealed to me that Ghosted was only supposed to be as long as it’s first five-issue arc, and this week marks the first issue of a new chapter in Jackson T. Winters’ career as a ghost hunter.
Rat Queens is probably one of the most fun books of 2013, and I keep eating it up.
As we all know, Brubaker can do no wrong. If you aren’t reading Velvet, well, you’re missing out.
Paul Jaissle
- Prophet #42
- Thor God of Thunder #17
- Velvet #3
Even though I’ve never been much a Jame Bond/spy fan, I’ve really been enjoying Brubaker and Epting’s Velvet. It’s a clever twist on the genre, and it’s great to see those two working together again.
‘The Accursed’ storyline wraps up in this issue of Thor God of Thunder. It’s been an uneven story, but I’m hoping Aaron and Garney can stick the landing.
Prophet is one of the stranger books out there. I’m never quite sure where the story is going, but Brandon Graham and his collaborators seem to be exploring the possibilities of visual storytelling in the comics medium.

More and more, my pull list is getting dominated by X-Men titles… and I’m more than ok with that. I will say that Amazing X-Men has failed to grab my attention yet, but I have hope that it will get better. On the other hand, Uncanny X-Men just keeps getting better and so does All-New X-Men.
On the other side of the Big 2 divide, I believe this is my last issue of Green Lantern Corps and I could not be more happy to be dropping all the Green Lantern books.
Finally, Superior Spider-Man is starting to really get better, though I will say that everything interesting about the main Spider-Man book has absolutely nothing to do with Spider-Man, but rather the support cast of characters and villains. But, with the announcement of Peter Parker returning in April, I think I can hold out just a bit longer to get Spidey back where it should be.

1340,"Procter & Gamble has been busy reinventing Gillette under pressure from lower-cost competitors. Think: big changes to marketing, innovation, online sales.
Now comes phase two of that reinvention — one that will probably bring changes to Gillette’s prominent complex on the Fort Point Channel in South Boston as well as its lower-profile sibling campus in Andover.
Gary Coombe, chief executive of P&G’s grooming business, told the company’s 1,300 Massachusetts employees Thursday that it is reassessing its two properties here. The stated goal: investment in new high-tech manufacturing equipment, R&D labs, and modern offices.
But with excess space at the 34-acre campus in South Boston and the 150-acre Andover location, real estate savings will be part of the equation.
Advertisement
Just how much extra land are we talking about? In Southie, buildings occupy just around 40 percent of the acreage; in Andover, it’s only about 10 percent, while most of the property is completely unused.
“Carrying a lot of underutilized land is an unnecessary expense that no business would want to bear,” Coombe told me.
Coombe said the company is just starting its assessment and hopes to have a decision by early next year. He didn’t rule out relocating the blade manufacturing operation from its South Boston home, where the company has had a proud presence for more than 100 years, although he said he doesn’t plan any job cuts in the region.
Regardless of the outcome, Coombe said P&G will maintain a “meaningful presence” in both communities.
P&G resisted selling pieces of its South Boston campus even as the neighborhood boomed around it — until General Electric came knocking. GE and state agency MassDevelopment acquired a section of the Gillette campus in late 2016 for GE’s new headquarters. (GE and the state have since sold that land to other developers, as GE scaled back its HQ plans.) Other deals have since been made, most notably the sale of a 6.5-acre parcel next door to the GE site, to developer Related Beal in May. There goes another parking lot.

Coombe said he hasn’t hired a real estate services firm yet to study the alternatives; he first wanted to break the news to employees.
You can’t blame Coombe for being deliberate in his choice of words when talking about the future of the “World Shaving Headquarters.” The P&G veteran knows the Southie property’s long-term fate has been a topic of water-cooler chatter ever since 2005, when the Cincinnati-based conglomerate scooped up a then-independent Gillette for $57 billion.
The Gillette reinvention had already begun when Coombe was appointed to run the grooming business in early 2018. He is proud of what his employees have done so far. He knows he needs them to pull off this transformation. He doesn’t want to scare them away, or make them worry about their future.
So Coombe emphasized that this is about making Gillette more competitive, not cashing in on valuable real estate.
“The next stage of that transformation is to make sure we have the facilities and the infrastructure in the Greater Boston area that we need to really win,” Coombe said. “Right now, we don’t, frankly.”
The seemingly inevitable reshaping of the South Boston campus may have more to do with the market forces in the shaving world, and less with the eager developers lining up on A Street.
Advertisement
The competition, to be honest, has been brutal. Gillette’s dominance has been whittled down over the past decade, in particular by direct-to-consumer outlets Harry’s and Dollar Shave Club. (Unilever now owns Dollar Shave Club, and Schick parent Edgewell is acquiring Harry’s.)
Under Coombe’s guidance, Gillette has fought back, beefing up Gillette’s mail-order market and rolling out new products such as the SkinGuard for men with sensitive skin.
The grooming business grew both top-line revenue and profit last quarter, the first time that has happened for two consecutive quarters in more than two years. But grooming, with its year-over-year organic sales growth of 1 percent, remained a notable laggard among P&G’s five distinct consumer-goods empires. Coombe knows his work isn’t done, not by a long shot.
Handled properly, the right real estate transactions could bring a new infusion of cash, to help invest in Gillette’s future. Gillette has been a fixture in Boston for more than a century. Coombe insists he wants to make the necessary changes to ensure the company thrives here for another one.

1026,"15 & 30 hours Government Funded Childcare
Childcare is a big expense for families. At Dizzy Ducks, we have worked very hard to find a way that we can make the new funded hours work. Find out more about the funding and how to apply below.
What is Government funded childcare?
All 3 & 4 year olds are eligible for 570 hours government-funded early education the term after they turn 3 years old. But from September 1140 hours government-funded early education is available to working parents of 3 & 4 yrs old. This equals to 30 hours of childcare over 38 weeks.
Am I eligible?
The Government has launched a new website called childcarechoices to help provide parents with information on all the current and upcoming changes to funding. You can check to see what help you can receive with your childcare costs and whether you are eligible by visiting:
Your child must be aged either 3 or 4 years old..
How do I apply?
For 15 hours you just need to complete the below Application form, but for 2 year old funding and 30 hours funding you need to apply for an eligibility code, please see details below.
Step 1: Check your eligibility at or the Childcare calculator at
Step 2: Apply for your eligibility code. Once approved you will receive an 11 digit code. This code, your National Insurance number and the child’s date of birth should then be given to us when you apply for a place.
Step 3: Apply for a 15 or 30 hours funded place at Dizzy Ducks. Parents must complete a Dizzy Ducks Enrolment form and provide the code, personal details and session preference.
- Billericay Application for Funded Sessions
- Hainault Application for Funded Sessions
- Harlow Application for Funded Sessions
- Haverhill Application for Funded Session
Step 4: Sign Terms and Conditions. If you have been successful in your application, your nursery manager will provide you with the appropriate Terms and Conditions to sign.
What sessions will be available?
Each nursery will provide a selection of full day and half day sessions for parents to choose from. Select your nursery below to find out the sessions we have available:
- Billericay Funded Sessions
- Hainault Funded Sessions
- Harlow Funded Sessions
- Haverhill Funded Sessions
Will you offer term time or stretched funding?
All nurseries will provide stretched funding over the full year, although a few nurseries will offer term time only. This is only available at a limited number of nurseries.
Will I lose my funding if I become ineligible?
If a parent becomes ineligible they will not lose their place immediately as there will be a national grace period enabling parents to retain the place.
Are the funded sessions completely free?
Government funding is to provide high-quality, flexible early education and childcare. The government guidelines state that funding should not be used for:
- Consumables – drinks, meals, nappies, gloves, arts and crafts materials, paint, glue, messy play resources, anti-bacterial gels…
- Additional services – EY log, cooking, music lessons, baby yoga, trips...the list goes on.
Therefore we will be introducing an “Additional Services & Consumables charge” for parents accessing the “free” hours. This is between 54p and £1 per hour, which we believe is exceptionally excellent value. This charge is optional but we will be offering a limited number of places whereby parents can access a funded place without the Additional Services and Consumables charge.
What is the Additionals and consumables charge? What will it cover?
Parents who choose to pay the Additional services and consumable charge will have access the full range of Dizzy Ducks services.
✔ All meals: two course home cooked meals including
a morning and afternoon snack
✔ Choose the days that you need
✔ Special events and classes including
Mini Moosic
✔ Trips offsite to the park
✔ Access EY Log
✔ Additional hours to stay 7am – 7pm
✔ Termly Parents Evenings
✔ Childcare Matters Magazine (termly)
✔ Weekly e-newsletter
✔ Guaranteed place until your child leaves school
✔ Free uniform
For further information contact our Accounts team on 01277 636408.

If you would like to receive more information on the 15 or 30 hours funding please fill in your details below",What is the process to apply for the government funded childcare at Dizzy Ducks?,"To apply for the government funded childcare at Dizzy Ducks, first, you need to check your eligibility.

- —Ryan, talking about the wine he brought to dinner
The Dinner is the sixteenth (chronologically the fifteenth) chapter of Beyond: Two Souls.
SynopsisEdit
After two years in the CIA, Jodie has a special dinner with a friend in honor of her new apartment.
PlotEdit
Jodie receives a phone call from Ryan, asking her if she got his email about going out to a fancy restaurant. At that moment realizing Ryan's email was the reason Aiden destroyed her computer, she apologizes for not reading it. He says it's too late now, but reschedules for another night. Jodie quickly invites him to her place, offering to cook instead, and he accepts.
Soon after, it's then a race against the clock to put everything into order.
- Clean the entire living room
- Dispose of any and all trash into the bin in the kitchen
- Put any and all dirty clothing into the hamper in the bathroom
- Replace all the books on the bookshelf
- Shove all the games underneath the TV stand
- (Optional): Turn on music
- (Optional): Turn on the lamp.
- (Optional): Take a shower
- (Optional): Lay on Jodie's bed and reassure herself
- (Optional): Wash the dishes
- Change out of sleeping clothes
- Sexy — a tight white blouse, and blue jeans
- Elegant — a slinky red dress (from The Embassy)
- Cool — a black and red shirt with ripped sleeves, and skinny jeans (from separation)
- Choose a meal with one the following options
- Order a pizza
- Chicken curry
- Asian beef
- Set the table (and automatically light candles)
During these preparations, Aiden will attempt to ruin her planning whenever possible. Halfway through, the doorbell will ring, and Jodie will start to panic, saying Ryan was early. She opens the door, only to find no one there. Should Jodie leave to look for Ryan, she will be locked out by Aiden, and to get back in, she will override control to open the door. This first time Jodie displays her ability for telekinesis without Aiden's help — as a result, Jodie's nose will bleed. Not going out will allow the player to carry on. He will then stack up all the chairs onto the table erratically and stop the clock in the living room. If Jodie chooses to take a shower, Aiden will write 'You don't need him you have me' in the fogged mirror. Jodie will then tell Aiden that he doesn't understand, and wipe the fogged mirror clean of his writing.
Soon, however, Ryan eventually shows up, bottle of wine in hand. Jodie greets him and shows him to her living room, as she goes into the kitchen to grab a corkscrew. Aiden will fling open the cupboards, oven, and fridge to deter her, but she shuts them and goes back to Ryan with two wine glasses, and the corkscrew. The two will then sip wine on the couch, and make conversation.
As Aiden, the player will have numerous attempts to derail the date, resulting in awkward pauses and Ryan becoming uncomfortable. Jodie will excuse herself by saying she had to check on the food, and will walk to the kitchen. She will chastise Aiden, and angrily tell him to go away. To avoid this, don't do anything while taking control of Aiden.
The two will then go eat at the table. If everything goes right, Ryan will confess his love to Jodie. You then have the choice to kiss him or go away. If you choose to kiss him, the two lovers will go to Jodie's bed. If you haven't got the ""Together Forever"" trophy, the love scene carries on. Otherwise, Jodie will stop him from getting further as she still has the memories from when she was almost sexually assaulted. Ryan will then leave her to cry alone. If Aiden spooks Ryan enough, he will leave reluctantly. Jodie will initially condemn Aiden but later admit that 'maybe he isn't the right one for me.'
If Aiden does nothing, but the player rejects the kiss as Jodie, she will ask if Aiden's happy. Aiden says in his own ghostly language that it isn't his fault. Jodie agrees, and admits that he maybe wasn't the type for her. As tears roll down her face, Aiden tries to console Jodie by filling the glass of wine. Jodie says that Aiden will always be there for her, drinks the wine, and the chapter ends.
TrophiesEdit
- Perfect Lover - Cooked a meal, cleaned the apartment, took a shower, wore the elegant dress and put on some music.
- Casual Girl - Ordered a pizza, watched some TV and wore something casual.
- In Love with Ryan - Slept with Ryan
- Uncontrollable - Ruin the dinner with Aiden. You MUST spook Ryan at the dinner table. This is the final requirement in a total of six in order to get this trophy.
TriviaEdit
- If Jodie has sneaked out to the bar as a teenager, in the chapter Like Other Girls, and has experienced the near sexual assault scene (and subsequently obtained the Together Forever trophy), she will not be able to make love to Ryan. She instead starts crying at the scars of her youth, and Ryan leaves, which will cancel the love scene.
- The address of her new apartment is 6192 Columbus Street. The apartment is located on the 9th floor.
- The Elegant Dress that Jodie can wear in this chapter is also the one she wears during The Embassy. Jodie's nails are painted the instant she wears the dress.
- the cool outfit you partly see in the separation as jodie pulls it out of her closet
- This is one of the few chapters that seem to show that Jodie has powers of her own, as she forces Aiden to open the apartment door. This takes a lot of effort to do, and may hint that she has telekinesis too.
- Another scene that shows this is during the Alone ending where Jodie travels around the country. She comes across spirits and entities she can still see even when not connected to Aiden.

Marketing on the Go
Most forward-thinking companies have addressed the need for mobile-friendly site design. However, there is much room for improvement. Why use mobile digital ads?
Studies show that retail conversion rates on smartphones are lower than on desktops. As a business owner, you should still focus on mobile conversion. Though mobile users search first on their phones, they frequently buy on computers. That is, mobile conversions are still important.
Mobile has a significant impact on search marketing because Google prioritizes mobile-friendly experiences. The needs of mobile users must be understood when developing websites.
Marketing Automation
Marketers must now use automated solutions. Marketing automation can help businesses streamline, automate, and measure processes. It improves operational efficiency and provides data for digital marketing operations. Streamlining processes like segmentation, lead generation, content marketing, client retention, and ROI tracking can help your company succeed. Now you just need to decide which marketing technology or automation software will work best for you.
Marketing on Social Media
Nonstop entertainment and instant communication are now expected. Businesses are interested in social media because of its reach and variety of ways to engage audiences. Social media marketing is becoming more popular. Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook are thriving in terms of usability and growth. Despite social media platforms’ attempts to monetize, businesses may have to pay to have influence.
Tailored Content
A campaign isn’t complete without content. Content evolves with online marketing. Personalization is an important aspect of creating content that connects and converts. Marketers believe that personalizing the web experience is critical to current and future success. The goal of every campaign should be to be as unique as possible. Customized content keeps customers coming back and is why digital marketing works.
Video Marketing
Cisco predicts that video traffic will quadruple between 2015 and 2020. Businesses that focus on video marketing are more likely to succeed in the future. Utilizing compelling video content across multiple platforms will help you attract more visitors and convert them.
Without a doubt, technology will continue to change how we market online. Marketing methods will continue to evolve to help businesses better connect with customers. To achieve long-term growth and a higher return on investment, you as a business owner must focus on creative marketing strategies.
Advertising with AI
A component of upcoming web advertising technology, but not widespread or well-known enough to be relevant to most advertising clients. “I don’t hear clients asking about it; it’s irrelevant to them,” is a common refrain in the advertising industry. Despite this, tech giants like Microsoft and retailers like Nordstrom are embracing AI-based advertising. According to a Microsoft report, improved CTR calculation accuracy has a significant impact on user search experience and financial revenue. An extra 0.1% accuracy would result in hundreds of millions of dollars, they claim.
Google, Alibaba, and Amazon have all launched AI and big data initiatives. It’s simple: too much good data doesn’t translate into valuable, usable, and revenue-generating insights. We can be confident that AI is improving internet advertising through predictive programming and analysis.
Predictive Programming
In terms of online advertising technology, predictive programming is a compelling example. This method collects and analyzes internet usage data from individual users. Where a user goes online, what they do there, how long they stay there, what they click or look at online, and how they get there.
This generates a lot of useful data that can be used to create more engaging, relevant, and efficient online advertising. Predictive programming is similar to re-targeting on the surface, but it is far more intricate and finely tuned. Retargeting is a highly effective ad strategy, but it has several flaws. Imagine being re-targeted after receiving a guitar strap as a gift. Predictive programming, on the other hand, does not rely on a single transaction or internet visit to serve ads.
How Can a Digital Ad Help Me?
On-line advertising is rapidly evolving. New technologies are changing traditional web advertising and how consumers interact with it. This is why digital advertising works. Consider the following technologies, which improve advertising ROI and change how marketers engage with customers.
As you can see, the relentless march of technology continues to fundamentally alter online advertising. These technologies will become increasingly important in online advertising and marketing as their measurement and ROI capabilities improve.",What is the impact of mobile phones and wearable devices on marketing?,Mobile phones and wearable devices are changing marketing. Brands struggle to interact with their audiences in real-time across all of these devices and create relevant marketing campaigns. Mobile has a significant impact on search marketing because Google prioritizes mobile-friendly experiences. The needs of mobile users must be understood when developing websites.

Viking Wind has two current projects in the order book for fall 2018. Both projects are already at an advanced stage.
The Greenland project:
Ultimo October/primo November Viking Wind is going to supply the town Sisimiut in Greenland with a wind turbine, which will be a part of a pilot project to test the stamina of the wind turbine under extreme weather conditions as seen in the artic area.
The purpose with the Greenland project is the development of “Off grid” projects for the future, very similar to the Argentine project (further reading here), where the Viking Wind turbine will produce energy to a unit independent of an already established electrical grid. That gives the opportunity to be able to produce electricity in far away and isolated areas (with out grid or limit access to the public grid) where electricity is sparse, without dependency on fossil fuel. By that the secluded areas will be self-sufficient and no longer have to depend solely on more pollutant energy sources. The bonus is more sustainability and less pollution and will bring endless possibilities for secluded and impassable areas.
In Greenland the entrepreneur is already working on establishing roads and making a foundation for the turbine.
The Vejroe project:
The second project is on a small danish island with Vejrø Resort as contractor. According to the schedule the Viking Wind turbine is to be erected medio October 2018.
Vejrø Resort offers luxury island holidays in magnificent surroundings. The Viking Wind turbine is a part of fulfilling their mission of sustainability in the energy field while accentuating aesthesia and minimize the interference with the surrounding nature.
The turbine will , combined with diesel, sun energy and battery Stored energy, reduced the use of fossil fuel and supply the resort with clean energy and thereby be a major contributor in minimizing the use of fossil fuel, for the benefit of more sustainability (further reading about the Vejrø resort here).
Viking Wind is proud to be a main actor in both exciting projects!",What is the purpose of the Greenland project by Viking Wind?,"The purpose of the Greenland project is the development of “Off grid” projects for the future, where the Viking Wind turbine will produce energy to a unit independent of an already established electrical grid.

158,"September 20, 2011-September 21, 2011 – I was watching the season premiere of SNL. It started with an announcement of the cast members, instead of the cold open. This opening montage featured a still photo of each cast member in the middle of the screen against a background of lights that looked like sped-up traffic. Kenan was the first one announced. Then there was a short opening sketch, which was barely an opening sketch. Alec Baldwin, the night’s host, was in the opening. At the end of the opening, nobody said, “Live from New York…” – it instead cut to the montage. Kenan was again the first cast member announced. After the montage, Amy Poehler introduced Maroon 5, who then performed. Amy remained on the main stage during the performance. It turned out that Amy was romantically involved with Adam Levine. This didn’t make sense to me, because, last I heard, she was still married to Will Arnett. I was wondering why Maroon 5 were performing, since Radiohead were the musical guest. Then I saw some indication that Amy wasn’t actually involved with Adam Levine and that she was still married to Will Arnett. But, ultimately it wasn’t clear either way.

2200,"If anyone tells you the second baby is full of challenges — not the baby itself, but all that surrounds it — that's true. If someone suggests that you've done it once so the second time is a piece of cake, tell them to shut it.
There is no muscle memory for the first month. It was a blur. It is a blur. The Pickle (name TBD) is nearly three weeks old, and we're nursing just fine (after a bumpy start with it feeling like he might sheer off my left nipple). Sure, I don't worry as much. With Bama, every breath instilled panic. This time, we know babies breath crazy (it helps he doesn't have a hole in his heart). I'm not maniacal about bathing or clothes. I keep his head covered in drafts, bundle him up when we go out (one layer more than I would wear), but every bump and decision isn't agony.
On the other hand, there are lots of issues and areas that are question marks. I pulled out the dreaded What to Expect book to jog my memory about what I should be looking for this month.
When does he get to tummy time (immediately)? When did we start reading to Bama (about now)? How often should we bathe him (more often than we are but not very)? When does a nap routine begin (still a blank)? Why is he a bat and how do I fix him (still a blank)? When will his smiles be ""real"" (end of the month; now, if you're my mother)? Best way to trim his nails (nail file or bite them; I use curved scissors)? How often should he poop/pee a day (minimum six wet diapers)?
And then we have the combined world of Bama and Pickle. Thank goodness Bama is enamored with her brother. I think we prepped her well. When I went to the hospital, she said we were getting her ""Tiny Baby."" Her baby. He is her little baby, without a doubt. She likes to do tummy time with him, shimmying into the baby gym to be on his level, encouraging him to lift his head. She pats his hand and head and says, ""It's okay, Pickle"" when he cries. She helps me nurse him, which isn't very helpful, but at least she's not asking to join in. Sometimes, her love is aggressive, as is the case with most toddlers because they don't have full control over their bodies, and she nearly tackles him in embrace or with a kiss.
He is a little bigger than his sister was, despite coming out of the oven a week ahead of his due date. (In the end, we opted for a second C-section. I let my VBAC dream go; it was the right thing to do.) 8 pounds, 13 ounces; 14-inch head; 21.5-inch body. Yet, he seems itty bitty, swimming in her clothes, positively munchkin-esque next to his sister.
We were lucky that my mother stayed with us for the week or so after I came home from the hospital. (She and Grandpa arrived two days before I went in; we wouldn't have made it without them.) I'd literally fall asleep on the sofa bed, leaving Bama to her care. I couldn't wake up from naps, I was so tired. I could hear my mother and Bama talking, but I was so under, it was enough to hear them.
This was probably the only visit my parents will be able to make while we live in NY. My mother and Bama reached an accord, with only unabashed sweetness coming from my girl on my mother's last day here. (It would have been nice if it had come a little earlier, but I'll take it.) In that extra 10 days she was here, my mom spent more time with the Pickle and Bama than she'd been able to while we all lived in California. She also got to remind me to ask for help and get some sleep. It was a conversation only a mother can have with her daughter.
2 thoughts on “It’s Not Like Riding a Bicycle”
Reminds me of when B first held E. So sweet and touching to see. She then turned to my mom and said, “Gamma, you want to hold my baby?” And here we thought that WE were having another baby. No, this one was all hers.
I am thankful she loves Pickle as she does. He cries, and she goes to him. She pats his head and holds his hand. There are worse things than total adoration.",What are some of the challenges and questions faced by the parent during the first month of the second baby's life?,"Some of the challenges and questions faced by the parent during the first month of the second baby's life include nursing issues, worrying less but still having concerns about the baby's health, not being overly concerned about bathing or clothes, and dealing with the baby's erratic breathing. The parent also has questions about when to start tummy time, when to start reading to the baby, how often to bathe the baby, when a nap routine begins, when the baby's smiles will be ""real"", the best way to trim the baby's nails, and how often the baby should poop/pee a day."
746,"Massage During Pregnancy
Many expectant mums will find it very difficult to lie on the stomach for any period of time by the fourth month of pregnancy. And, generally, it isn’t a wise idea to lay flat on your back during the latter part as this may make you feel light headed and the weight of the foetus can restrict the circulation and cause a tingling sensation in the legs. With the proper position and a well-trained therapist, a massage is useful for the following reasons:
- Massaging the legs counteract the effects of oedema, varicose veins and tiredness. The legs and the arms may be treated with your body in a semi-supine position or sitting in a comfortable chair.
- You can be seated, leading forward with cushions for support to have you back massaged.
- For a variety of ethical reasons, however, massaging the abdomen is not a good idea. The most a therapist can do is apply oil with light effleurage strokes.
Also, be clear and concise with your instructions!

Media Literacy Education in the Age of Machine Learning
Abstract
The media environment has radically changed over the past few decades. Transition and transformation of media platforms has enabled algorithms and automation to take over media processes such as production, content generation, curation, delivery, recommendation, and filtering of information. It has also enabled tracking of users’ actions, data mining, profiling, and the use of computational and machine learning techniques for purposes like behavior engineering, targeted advertisement, spread of mis- and disinformation, swaying political moods, and many others. In the field of media literacy education, the need to understand algorithm-driven media requires educators to re-think the connections between media literacy education and computing education. This article provides an overview of some computational mechanisms of new media, and it provides new perspectives for media literacy education. The article suggests ways of intertwining media literacy education with computing education in order to improve students’ readiness to cope with modern media and to become critical and skilled actors to navigate in the new media landscape.

After months of uncertainty, Gov. Jan Brewer this week has proposed a fresh set of middle-of-the-road budget cuts in the state’s medical program for the poor, which provides coverage for nearly one in three Gila County residents.
However, this week the Senate adopted a budget that included Brewer’s original,, deeper cutbacks.
Brewer signed the 2011 legislative budget which eliminates the Arizona variant of the State Children's Health Insurance Program program, known as KidsCare, that provides health insurance to uninsured children[21] whose families' income exceeds the Medicaid cutoff.[22] According to the FY 2011 budget, enrollment caps will also be put into place for Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS), thereby limiting access to the program.

6' 4-Wire 30, Dryer Cord (PT600L Other) - In addition to grounding the frame of the range or clothes dryer, the grounded circuit conductor of those present branch circuits is likewise authorized to be used to ground any junction packing containers within the circuit presenting the appliance, and a three-cord pigtail and variety receptacle are authorised to be used. The exception to 250.A hundred and forty applies only to current branch circuits presenting the appliances specified in 250.140.

Department circuits mounted for new equipment installations are required to provide an gadget grounding conductor sized in accordance with 250.122 for grounding the non–current-wearing metallic elements.

In that case, what do i do approximately the spot for the grounding twine? I would love to look a video/image of this being accomplished.

The electric cable whether romex or old-fashioned steel included bx has a ground cord (the metal guard if bx or a naked floor wire if romex) - just pass it from wherever it is related (usually to the metallic junction container mounting screw) and make bigger it to the brand new replacement 14-30r receptacle which you ought to have bought from anywhere you purchased the dryer (or you could get it at lowes or home depot) - we're talking about $11 bucks, there about - this can come up with your 4 wire/4 pin connection (hot - black, warm - crimson, neutral - white and naked copper- floor) proper at your outlet - no want to run a further cord from within the field to the dryer. Placed lower back the 4 prong twine that got here with the dryer - make certain no bond from white to floor and be performed with it - value is minimum and a far neater and safer manner to do it.

The court heard in July how the teenager was standing in a nearby cul-de-sac, covered in blood and carrying a blood-stained Stanley knife as she rang 999 to tell police what she had done.
The judge was told she may have been trying to prove the youngster was not a robot, as she had ""irrational beliefs"" about how people ""may not be human and may be controlled by a higher and hostile force"", a court heard earlier this year.
The girl denied murder but pleaded guilty to manslaughter by diminished responsibility at hearing at Leeds Crown Court. This plea was accepted by the prosecution and she will be sentenced on Thursday by Mr Justice Soole.
The judge has heard how the girl began suffering from mental health problems more than a year before the killing.
Prosecutors said she had reported delusional thoughts as well as depression, self-harm and suicidal thoughts.
They said the girl had talked of being convinced that people ""weren't human and were robots"".
He said the girl became distressed when one doctor asked her later ""whether she killed Katie to test whether she was a robot"".
The court heard that, although psychosis was being investigating prior to the killing, it had not been diagnosed.

1388,"Planning Commission upbeat about medical tourism, grim on citizen healthcare
Medical tourism to India may have increased spectacularly in recent years, but for most ordinary Indian citizens healthcare services remain a nightmare. With this in mind, the government is formulating a health insurance scheme that will cover the country’s entire below-the-poverty-line population in five years
A high-level group of the Planning Commission in India reported in 2002 that as many as 150,000 medical tourists travelled to India, bringing in earnings of around $ 300 million. The number of people visiting India for medical treatment continued to increase by at least 25% every year since then, and the latest report by the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) and McKinsey says earnings will go up to $ 2 billion by 2012.
The CII-McKinsey report, released recently by Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, compared the cost of medical procedures in a few countries. For example, heart bypass surgery costs $ 6,000 in India, $ 7,894 in Thailand, $ 10,417 in Singapore, $ 19,700 in Britain and $ 23,938 in the US. Likewise, heart valve replacement surgery costs $ 8,000 in India, $ 10,000 in Thailand, $ 12,500 in Singapore, $ 90,000 in Britain and $ 200,000 in the US.
According to the Planning Commission, better quality medical services together with the low cost of surgeries are reasons why people from other countries, most of them from SAARC countries but also an increasing number from the United States and Britain, are flocking to India for medical treatment. The Indian government has also stepped in to facilitate visa procedures for medical tourists.
However, the Planning Commission paints a grim picture when it comes to healthcare facilities for the country’s citizens, admitting that all is not well in India’s public healthcare sector as it joins other nations to mark World Health Day.
The high-level group said in a report last week that public healthcare has been on a serious decline in the last two or three decades because of non-availability of medical and paramedical staff, diagnostic services, and medicines.
The Planning Commission has squarely blamed the shortage of medical professionals for the bleak scenario saying there was the need for at least 600,000 more doctors. The situation vis-à-vis availability of specialist manpower at community health centres is particularly bad. “As against the sanctioned posts, about 59.4% of surgeons, 45% of obstetricians and gynaecologists, 61% of physicians and 53% of paediatricians were not in position,” says the report.
The number of doctors registered by different state councils stood at 668,131 in 2006, resulting in a doctor-to-population ratio of 60:100,000. The state-wide distribution of doctors was also highly skewed, with certain states like Karnataka, and the union territories of Delhi and Goa having a favourable ratio while other states like Haryana, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh were underserved, the group said.
If the targeted doctor-to-population ratio is taken as 1:1,000, there is a requirement for at least 600,000 doctors. The group also drew attention to the acute shortage of dental surgeons in India. The number of dental surgeons registered in India stood at 73,271, against a requirement for 282,130 in 2007, it said. There is a similar shortage of nurses. While the ideal population of nurses should have been 2,188,890 in 2007, at present there are only 1,156,372 nurses.
Asserting that the overriding requirement in India is to increase the supply of human resources at all levels, from specialists to paramedical personnel, and to improve quality, the group, headed by commission member Anwarul Hoda, said this could be accomplished by opening up the medical education sector to private sector participation.
Private companies should be allowed to establish medical and dental colleges just as they have been allowed to open nursing colleges, he said. Other barriers such as land and built-up space should be brought down to realistic levels.
The recommendations, submitted by the group to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, included asking the government to fill up vacant posts in order to improve the quality of teaching at government medical colleges and to enable these colleges to provide higher incentives.
A paramedical council for regulatory purposes and an institute of paramedical sciences should be established at the earliest to cope with the shortage of paramedical staff, it added.
Meanwhile, the government is formulating a health insurance scheme that will cover the entire below-the-poverty-line (BPL) population of 30 crore in five years, the Planning Commission disclosed in its report.
The insurance policy is taking shape following the recommendations of the National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganised Sector (NCEUS). It has been estimated that the premium per family will amount to Rs 750, of which 75% will be paid by the central government and the remaining 25% by the state government. The cost of the smart card will be borne by the Centre; the beneficiaries will only need to pay Rs 30 per annum towards registration or renewal charges.
While state governments will determine the benefits that beneficiaries will be entitled to, the proposal is that hospitalisation expenses will take care of most common illnesses, all pre-existing diseases will be covered, and transportation costs up to Rs 1,000 will be covered, says the Planning Commission group.

Hi Gail and All,
I teach in a district that is stringently non-denominational about
every major holiday. We don't use the H-word (Halloween) or the C-
word (you can guess what that is) and we still manage to do nice
observances around this time of year. How about celebrating the
winter season and peace on earth? These are themes that are timely
and non-denominational. Winter animal themes are also appropriate;
doves, foxes, rabbits, moose, deer, etc. Try a winter weather
approach and do imagery about snow, crystals, and the need for
bonfires, etc.
A nice, quick, simple, kid-friendly gift to make are bird-feeder pine
cones. Get nice pine cones and drill a small hole in the large end.
Insert an eye hook and a pretty cord to hang them up. Spray a
mixture of diluted gelatin and water (gelatin can be found in the
canning section at the market) and then roll them in bird seed. I
buy 50 lb. bags of bird seed for under $10 at Walmart. We then
package these gifts in cellophane with a ribbon. Everyone really
loves them and they make a nice ecological gift to the birds. By the
way, I saw this idea in the Smith and Hawkins winter catalog last
winter and they cost big bucks!!
For cards and wrapping paper, try printing with oil-based non-
hardening clay and stamp pads. Form the clay into a stamp base,
impress a design into it and then stamp. You can do a central design
for cards or a repeating design for nice wrapping paper. Try gold and
silver ink stamp pads on colored paper. You can get these stamp pads
in specialty crafts stores like Michael's (in California).
Best wishes to all for a lovely winter season and peace on earth!!

1645,"Abstract
Dominant white, Dun, and Smoky are alleles at the Dominant white locus, which is one of the major loci affecting plumage color in the domestic chicken. Both Dominant white and Dun inhibit the expression of black eumelanin. Smoky arose in a White Leghorn homozygous for Dominant white and partially restores pigmentation. PMEL17 encodes a melanocyte-specific protein and was identified as a positional candidate gene due to its role in the development of eumelanosomes. Linkage analysis of PMEL17 and Dominant white using a red jungle fowl/White Leghorn intercross revealed no recombination between these loci. Sequence analysis showed that the Dominant white allele was exclusively associated with a 9-bp insertion in exon 10, leading to an insertion of three amino acids in the PMEL17 transmembrane region. Similarly, a deletion of five amino acids in the transmembrane region occurs in the protein encoded by Dun. The Smoky allele shared the 9-bp insertion in exon 10 with Dominant white, as expected from its origin, but also had a deletion of 12 nucleotides in exon 6, eliminating four amino acids from the mature protein. These mutations are, together with the recessive silver mutation in the mouse, the only PMEL17 mutations with phenotypic effects that have been described so far in any species..
Integration of PMEL17 transmembrane segments into microsomal membranes. (A) Wild-type Lep has two N-terminal TM segments (H1, H2) and a large luminal domain (P2). PMEL17-derived segments corresponding to the transmembrane region (PMEL) were inserted between residues 226 and 253 in the P2 domain. Glycosylation acceptor sites (G1, G2) were placed in positions 96–98 (Asn-Ser-Thr) and 258–260 (Asn-Ala-Thr), flanking the PMEL segment. For constructs with a PMEL segment that integrates into the membrane, only the G1 site is glycosylated (top left), whereas both the G1 and G2 sites are glycosylated for PMEL segments that do not integrate in the membrane (top right). (B) Membrane integration of PMEL17-derived transmembrane segments. Plasmids encoding the Lep-PMEL17 constructs were transcribed and translated in vitro in the absence (−RM) and presence (+RM) of dog pancreas rough microsomes. 0G, unglycosylated protein; 1G, singly glycosylated protein; 2G, doubly glycosylated protein. Molecular weight markers are shown in the first lane. WT, wild type; DW, Dominant white. ∼800 ∼800.

1909,"Shakespeare: The World as Stage
As a very impressionable college student, I fell instantly in love with literature and the insights I gained from various authors' perspectives--Jane Austen, Eudora Welty, Chaucer to name a few. However, when I first learned that ""all the world's a stage,"" I was especially intrigued by William Shakespeare and his innate ability to see inside the human soul.
In college, I took a course solely devoted to studying Shakespeare's plays. I spent many late nights, disheveled and tired, listening to and reading ""Much Ado About Nothing,"" ""As You Like It,"" ""Hamlet,"" ""MacBeth,"" and ""Romeo and Juliet"" over and over again, until my eyes stung. So once I saw Bill Bryson's book on the shelf, I had an epiphany: I really don't know Shakespeare at all! After devoting time to reading, discussing, listening (thank goodness for CD Books!) and writing about his works, I really don't know anything about the playwright himself! How can this be?! But, after reading Bryson's biography of Shakespeare, I was relieved when I learned no one really does.
In Shakespeare: The World as Stage, Bill Bryson sets out to uncover what we really know about Shakespeare, and actually proves that much of what we think we know about Shakespeare is mere speculation. Furthermore, he discusses how conjectures often turn into ""facts"" due to the insatiable need to know more about the elusive character of the famous playwright. Bryson stresses how ""there is nothing--not a scrap, not a mote--that gives any certain insight into Shakespeare's feelings or beliefs as a private person."" Yet, we know that Shakespeare used 138,198 commas, 26,794 colons and 15,785 question marks in his works.
With little known facts about Shakespeare, Bryson does an excellent job of transporting the reader to the Elizabethan era and society: the monarchy, the social conventions, the food, the politics, and much more. For example, in sixteenth-century England, the threat of plague outbreaks--and various other diseases--were consistently a reality for the populace. If an Elizabethan did survive the plague, a similar, yet much more gruesome, fate was often realized by one accused of treason (You'll have to read the book to find out). Also, did you know that Elizabethans thought black teeth were fashionable?
I have always been a Bill Bryson fan, and I have always loved his clever approach to ordinary topics, such as walking the Appalachian Trail in A Walk in The Woods and the home in At Home: A Short History of Private Life. I promise this book will not disappoint, especially if you have always been curious about the life of William Shakespeare. If you are interested in learning more about William Shakespeare or another influential person, Cecil County Public Library has an excellent selection of biographies, ready for you to check out.

2357,"We have been trying the “new” seizure medication, in varying dosages, since February. Robert’s neurologist thought we should try Trileptal so, in February, started him on 300 mg in the morning and evening.
After a week, we had to give it up.
He was dizzy, cranky and could barely walk straight. Oh but it was heartbreaking because the seizures had stopped!
I didn’t want to give up so quickly so at the next neurology appointment, the doctor and I decided we could start it up again at a much slower pace. We started out with Robert getting 150 mg in the morning and 150 mg in the evening.
We kept him on this dosage for three weeks. Robert was cranky again and having a bit of difficulty walking but it wasn’t near as bad as the side-effects while on the higher dose. The seizures weren’t completely gone but the frequency had been reduced significantly.
After about three weeks there were more seizures. More seizures but his moodiness was better and his walking had improved. With the doctor’s approval, I increased the Trileptal again. This time we went to 150 mg in the morning and 300 mg in the evening. Richard and I thought if he had the stronger dose in the evening the side-effects wouldn’t be so bad.
It was a really, really good theory.
We have kept Robert on the 150/300 regimen for over a month.
Robert’s balance and inability to walk continued to get worse. There were times it actually seemed like he was getting better and the side-effects weren’t that bad but after looking at the log we keep, that just wasn’t the case.
The reality is he can barely move his legs in the morning. It is routine now for me to help him out of bed in the morning since he can’t get his legs working properly. Once he is up, he swerves with his walker with his right leg usually a few steps behind the rest of him and his walker pushed out as far as his arms can reach. No amount of coaching can get his legs and arms and brain working in unison or even staying in the same zip code.
Robert’s moodiness also continued. Robert has always had angry outbursts (one time when he lived in an assisted living facility he yelled for the nurse to “go to hell.” When I talked to him about it he insisted he just said that in his head and certainly wouldn’t say that out loud!)
Those outbursts are infrequent. Now they are an almost daily occurrence. Robert gets angry at anyone and everyone – us, the transport drivers, the Day Program staff, the respite staff and the dogs. He is hypersensitive to everything: noise, water temperature – even his gums are sensitive.
Day Program called to tell me that they are concerned about Robert’s safety. They have to occasionally put him in a wheelchair because of his fall risk but now he is arguing about having to sit in a wheelchair.
In addition to all of this, Robert developed excessive saliva which was not helping his congestion problem. He even choked a few times on it! Yikes!
It seems so obvious that we shouldn’t subject him to this medication with these awful side-effects but I kept thinking there were other reasons for these behaviors. Maybe it’s the bronchitis he keeps getting; maybe it’s all the turmoil of the house upgrades; maybe his swallow problem is getting worse. Maybe he has some other problem going on that is unrelated to the medication.
It actually wasn’t so obvious with all these “maybes” swirling in my head. Plus, it is hard to dismiss the fact the medication is working to reduce his seizures.
His seizures have dropped from a high of 59 in February to 54 in March, 40 in April and 20 in May. Oh my god! He is having a third of the seizures he had before starting on the medication. A third!!
It is only because of this that I kept Robert on Trileptal for this long. I kept thinking the side-effects would wear off. That we would see the “old” Robert and he would be able to move from room to room with some wobbliness but not what we’re seeing now. That once the house was back to normal and his congestion cleared up we would see his mood improve and his ability to walk come back.
I wanted to be sure we gave this medication enough of a shot before saying, “Nope. It’s just not worth the cost.”
I finally think we did.
I have come to the conclusion we have to take him off this medication. I have a message in to the neurologist so he can tell me how long I should take to wean him off the meds. In the meantime, I reduced the dose back to 150/150.
We gave this a shot. A really good shot but it’s doing more harm than good. We have to give up on this medication. I hate to quit or give up on anything but I know it’s the right thing to do.
I still have faith we will find something that works but I am not looking forward to increased seizures in the meantime.

I am so sorry Trish.... I know how disappointing this is for you. Sometimes we have to make tough decisions and from me staying updated with the saga of Robert's medication I believe you are making the right decision.
I hope that you get the ""old"" Robert back.

(((Big Hugs!))) So many tradeoffs here. I agree with Jane -- you have been diligently keeping track of all the pieces and you are working on constructing the best and most loving puzzle possible. <3
Oh Trish, what a heartbreak. You are so diligent with Robert, no one could do better. You're all in my heart and prayers daily. Hoping the days of excellent are coming soon. <3
Jane, e_journeys and Pegi, I apologize for the late reply. I so appreciate all of the support you give to me, Richard and Robert.

607,"We sell hammer shanks AND repair sleeves for all sizes of pianos.
We also sell hammer shanks and flanges for Grand Pianos
We sell brass sleeves and split sleeves for repairing broken hammers. Order them from our Online Catalog.
Order new hammer shanks on the same page. Be sure to tell us on the phone if you have a spinet or a full sized upright.
To make the repair with the sleeves, remove the hammer butt and broken piece. Disconnect the bridle strap and remove the screw in the hammer butt. I hope you have one of those screw drivers that grabs the screw in the slot. If you drop the screw inside the action, fish it out with a pickle grabber or a magnet.
If the shank is broken in the middle, you can use the brass or split sleeves. Trim the ends of the breaks a little bit so that they will fit together without elongating the shank once it is repaired, but do not shorten the overall length of the shank by whittling too much. Make sure the ends mess well before making the glued repair step. Slide the sleeve down over the end of the shank with some Elmer's carpenter's glue in it. Push the other shank broken end down into the sleeve until the broken ends meet and mess well. Lay it down to dry well before installing it in the action.
If you use the brass sleeves, which seem to do a better job, you may find that the sleeve is slightly small than the shank. In this case, scrape the ends of the break with a sharp knife until the ends are slightly smaller and will receive the sleeve snugly.
If the break is near the hammer butt or the hammer head, you must replace the shank.
For this job you will need a new hammer shank from my Catalogue, or from your piano tuner. In the tool department you will need a drill bit, which you can purchase from me. You may also have the size in your tool kit. DO NOT bring a high speed electric drill around anywhere near this job.
Here is the procedure:
1. Cut off the shank with a knife so that the shank end is flush with the body of the hammer butt, and do the same with the hammer head. Use some pointed tool to make a dimple in the shank bit in the butt and hammer head precisely in the center of the embedded piece or shank. Find a drill exactly the size of the shank piece you removed, and carefully drill out the shank piece. The hole in the hammer butt should be no more than three eighths of an inch deep. You can buy a hand held drill for this purpose at our Tool Parts Page in the Online Catalog. If you have a battery operated electric drill that does not have much power and can run real slow, you can use that. Otherwise, just hold the drill in your fingers, and suffer a little.
If the hammer was set at an angle on the shank, you must again drill the shank piece out at the same angle. In drilling the hole in the hammer head, try not to go all the way through the hammer head. We sell a jig for drilling out the hammers and butts in the Online Catalog. If you will be doing many of these tasks, you should invest in the jig.
2. Remove a good hammer from the piano. This one will be your pattern. Be careful as you push the jacks to one side to get at the screws. Don't push the jacks too far. Cut a shank, which you ordered from us, so that it will fit into the holes in the butt and hammer head and be the right length. This can be determined by laying the good hammer down and arranging the pieces of the hammer, butt, and shank being repaired next to it. Cut the shank accordingly. Is your repaired one too long? If so, take the hammer off, and carve off a bit of the shank.
Here is a graphic showing how to do the above task.
Next, fit the shank into the hammer butt hole without glue. Is it true or straight up and down with the hammer butt? If not, use the drill to ream out the hole so that the shank can be made to come straight out of the hole. After doing this, the shank will be quite loose, but it's not the end of the world.
With Elmer's glue, insert the shank into the hammer butt and hammer head, and immediately adjust the thing so that it will lay flat and look just like the good sample hammer. Lay the repaired on on its side on a flat surface so that it is the same as the sample, and let it completely dry for eight hours before installing it.
Put the hammers back into the action. If the repaired hammer is twisted of bent looking, you will need to bend it as in Chapter Six, sub-topic, H. Straighten a crooked hammer. You may also have to adjust the capstan on the back end of the key lever to bring the hammer to rest on the backrest properly
A grand piano can be repaired with a sleeve, but I always use the split sleeve since the brass one will not fit well. Almost all grand shanks are six sided, so the split sleeve seems to hold better. Still, you need to glue it all together.
You can order new Grand Piano Shanks and flanges
from our Online Catalog.
Suppose you do not have a brass sleeve, and this is an emergency, such as the cantata is tonight. You can still make the repair.
Lay the hammer pieces on a flat surface with the ends of the break meshed together WITHOUT glue. Make sure the shank is straight in all directions by supporting the middle where the break is. When you are sure of your arrangements, glue the ends of the break together with the wood glue. Lay the assembly back down straight, and let the hammer dry for at least four hours.
Next, carefully pick up the hammer, and wind cotton thread around the break area, covering the whole break with several passes of thread. Dampen the thread with the wood glue, and smear on a layer over the whole repair when you are done. I have seen this kind of repair still holding that had to be 50 years old. Aren't you a genius?
The best thread for this task would be the kind used to wind fishing rods. This is found at almost any sports and fishing shop. Tell the owner that you are winding a rod that is only six inches long. He will think you are going ice fishing for minnows :-)",What are the steps to repair a broken piano hammer shank with a sleeve?,"To repair a broken piano hammer shank with a sleeve, first remove the hammer butt and broken piece.

1891,"Whenever friends tell me they are feeling blue, I tell them to take a weekend, stock up on cold seltzer, and binge “Pose.” The show, which aired on FX last year, takes place in the spangled, sparkling demimonde of the New York drag-ball scene in the nineteen-eighties, where glamour met house music met vibrant queer expression met a hot-glue gun and a prayer. The show is a Funfetti cake of visual pleasure, and one of the highlights is Billy Porter, who plays the ballroom m.c. Pray Tell, barking orders from the stage in neon-green suits and enormous fedoras. Porter, who also has had major success on Broadway (he won a Tony for playing the drag queen Lola in “Kinky Boots”), has been making the most of the press circuit for his show’s début season, working every red carpet that he has appeared on this year with a zeal and creativity that makes everyone else look drab. At the A.F.I. Awards, in January, Porter wore a floor-length gown the color of farm-fresh egg yolks beneath a golden blazer. At the Golden Globes, two days later, he wore a hot-pink cloak, displaying the garment like a bird of paradise flapping its way through a mating dance. And, at the Critics’ Choice Awards, he wore a chocolate satin suit with a comically oversized soft-peach bow at the hip, a fanciful caricature of a cummerbund.
On the Oscars red carpet, on Sunday night, Porter managed to outdo himself yet again. He wore a “tuxedo gown” by the designer and “Project Runway” winner Christian Siriano, a sumptuous collision of butch-femme aesthetics.. Porter, who interviewed celebrities on the red carpet as part of ABC’s pre-show special, was one of the first people to arrive, and his dramatic look felt like a dare to everyone who would follow..
In a piece for Vogue about his Oscars outfit, Porter recalled approaching Siriano at the after-party for the designer’s most recent fashion show. He had learned that he’d be hosting a pre-Oscars show for ABC, and he asked Siriano if he’d make him a gown. (Siriano’s response: “AAAAA-BSOLUTELY.”) Porter wrote that he wanted to wear the gown in order to play with the gender binary, to melt the lines between masculine and feminine that red-carpet conventions tend to reinforce. “My goal is to be a walking piece of political art every time I show up. To challenge expectations. What is masculinity? What does that mean?” Porter’s outfit set a tone for the evening. So much of the history of the Oscars is about good behavior: wearing tasteful, elegant gowns, thanking the right people when you graciously accept your statuette. But, as Richard Brody wrote, in a piece sharing his awards predictions, as long as the Oscars remains a “stodgy, sometimes shticky, backward-looking self-celebration of a wealthy, and mostly white and male, industry,” it will be at risk of becoming irrelevant in a changing world. Stars like Porter, who strutted the red carpet as assistants helped fluff out the hemline of his skirt, are using fashion to show one route forward for the festivities. “People are going to be really uncomfortable with my black ass in a ball gown,” he wrote. “But it’s not anybody’s business but mine.”","Who designed the ""tuxedo gown"" that Billy Porter wore to the Oscars?","The ""tuxedo gown"" that Billy Porter wore to the Oscars was designed by Christian Siriano, a ""Project Runway"" winner."

RESHAPING AMERICA
In 1966, two sociology professors, Richard Cloward and Francis Piven, outlined a plan calling for the overloading of America’s welfare system to precipitate a crisis that would perpetuate a new social scheme of guaranteed minimum income.
The “Cloward Piven Strategy” is still alive and well today and at work at our southern border.
With border patrol ordered to stand down, the floodgates have been opened and the mass influx of illegals will surely be utilized as an additional cog wheel for the strategy. It also goes without saying that the “border crisis” will eventually serve as extra fuel in the drive toward open borders and the advancement of the U.S. into a North American Union.
While visiting Brownsville, Texas, Nancy Pelosi stated that “this is a community with a border going through it” and that “what others are calling a crisis should be viewed as an opportunity.” But an opportunity for what or whom, exactly? Further integration, more spending, the propping up of a voter class that is subservient to the welfare state?
Huge problems should be foreseen when someone like David Petraeus (former CIA head and U.S. military commander) says “after America, there is North America.”
It seems as though an insidious agenda is unfolding as Obama reshapes America. People who are supporting amnesty and calling for open borders are ultimately supporting the end of America. What is a country without its borders? How much money can be spent on what number of people until we finally collapse into a third-world cesspit not unlike those from which the so-called “migrants/refugees” are trying to escape?
Speaking of which, Guatemala’s first lady, Rosa Leal de Perez, is on record stating that violence isn’t the reason kids are heading north, but rather kids are primarily traveling to the U.S. in order to reunite with family.
There is more than just a humanitarian crisis going on at the border. America better wake up before there is no longer an America left to wake up in!

EXCUSING THE INEXCUSABLE
It seems to me if corporations continue to be granted rights similar to those of the individual, they should also be subject to the laws and penalties regarding individuals.
If a corporation like Citigroup defrauds consumers, robbing millions of people of billions of dollars in life savings, someone should be brought up on charges of felony theft, complete with hefty prison sentences, rather than fines and/or penalties.
If “corporations are people, too,” then why do the rights of some (corporations) outweigh the rights of others (employees, consumers)?
If Hobby Lobby was owned by a Jehovah’s Witness, would it be able to deny its employees insurance coverage for blood transfusions, as it is now legally allowed to deny coverage of certain forms of birth control, claiming religious freedom?
Corporations are not people, they are institutions steered by groups of individuals who sometimes excuse inexcusable, immoral, and unethical behavior on the basis of a finely-tuned mob mentality.
If all are to blame, none is held accountable. We, or a majority of us, like to call ourselves a Christian nation, but our actions belie that notion.
God is not our chief deity, Mammon is.

FINDLAY HAS TOO MANY EYESORES
Having moved from Findlay earlier this year, I had the opportunity to visit family and friends there a couple weeks ago. I was amazed at the “new happenings” that are taking place, like Marathon’s “little city” being built, among others.
What really was disheartening, if there is such a word, is that abandoned properties along U.S. 224 and Ohio 12, better known as Tiffin Avenue, have grass that is growing tall and the properties themselves are really an eyesore.
Some of these have real estate agent signs in the yard and some are probably in a banks’ hands. Those in charge of those properties should be responsible enough to keep the grass trimmed and the property presentable even for those who drive by.
This not only happens in that area but also in areas all over the city. I went back into the neighborhood (Dayton Avenue) where I grew up and was sickened by a property that has been vacant for a long time and is decaying slowly. The owner has thrown tarps over the dilapidated roof, and the property itself is deplorable.
Property values of the homes around it would probably be lessened due to the condition of this property. Why has this been allowed to happen?
I love the city but let’s not allow properties, whether Realtor-owned or bank-owned, to put a bad taste in our mouths.

By
Matt Morgan
USES:
I usually use this protein with my meals the slower digesting whey concentrate is perfect for a steady feed of protein threw the day.
My preferred methods of this is to add it to oatmeal with a scoop of peanut butter this is a prefect meal with a lean protein source complex carbs and healthy fats.
I also will add it to pancake mix or waffle mix.
It is also very good before a workout to keep a steady stream of amino acids fueling your muscle and keeping you from entering a catabolic state during your workout.
It can also be used post workout but i would give whey isolate a sligh edge here.
So i would recommend a whey concentrate over isolate as a throughout the day protein source since it last longer in your system the only three times id use an isolate over it is first thing when i wake up, post workout two times when the faster digesting and acting isolate is better and if you are lactose intolerant.
Rating: Profile 10/10
You wont find a whey concentrate with a better profile.
Taste 8.5/10
I prefer the cinnamon bun over this but it is still very good if your a chocolate lover which i am not.
Mixablity 10/10
Nearly instantly completely dissolves whether you add it to milk water or even pancake mix and oatmeal.

UPGRADING CS700 TO CS700A
AND
UPGRADING CS700 TO CS750
To upgrade from a CS700 to a CS700A requires the following steps:
1. Get a copy of the tuning parameters.
2. Take the radio apart to get to the PCB
3. Short two points on the PCB and turn on Power
4. Load New Driver
5. Load New Firmware
6. Convert new tuning parameters to new turning parameters
7. Use service Monitor to tune certain parameters if necessary
8. Initialize code plug
There are three issues with having the customers do this themselves.
(1) If you make a mistake you might brick the radio and could take at least 4 hours to recover.
(2) If you short the wrong spot on the radio you might damage the radio.
(3) We have no way of protecting our intellectual property from being copied by other manufacturers.
Connect Systems decided that because we cannot have the customers do the upgrading themselves because of the above reasons, we would charge a nominal fee of only $20 including shipping within United States to upgrade an old CS700 to the new CS700A. For customers outside the United States, we will charge $15 plus shipping. For those customers it would be advantageous to ship multiple radios at the same time.
To Convert the CS700 to a CS750 requires the changing of a memory chip. This means unsoldering an existing IC and soldering in a new IC. Then you following the above 8 instructions. For that the price is $60 including shipping. For customers outside the United States, we will charge $55 plus shipping. For those customers it would be advantageous to ship multiple radios at the same time.
To upgrade your radio call (818) 889-0503 after the Dayton Hamvention for a RMA number. With the RMA number, you must include the radio, your return shipping address, and a check or credit card number to cover the cost of upgrade.

CS300 Radio for Visually Impaired
Summary
The purpose of the this radio is to achieve two things:
(1) Have a radio that is ideally suited for the vision impaired population.
(2) Have a test bed to test some of the concepts for the CS7000 multi-protocol radio.
Background
Early in the development of the CS7000, I promised some Hams that the CS7000 will be ideally suited for the Hams that are visually impaired. It is now time to meet that promise and develop an inexpensive test bed to prove the concepts
I decided that it might make sense to take the CS100 radio and partially rewrite the firmware to achieve this purpose. This radio is a top of the line commercial radio that is every bit as good as the Motorola commercial radios. Once the development and testing is completed for this radio, and it has been in the field tested by visually impaired Hams, the feedback will allow the CS7000 to have a fully optimized visually impaired radio at a reasonable price.
Other Advantages
Beside being designed for the visually impaired, this radio will have other advantages and features that might interest the larger Amateur Radio Community.
(1) This radio will be ideally suited for emergency operations where the lighting is too low to easily operate a normal radio.
(2) This radio will be programmed without having a computer.
(3) This radio will have special macro features that will allow the average HAM to program the radio to do functions no other radio can do. As an example, the user can program the radio to wake him up at a predetermined time, then transmit a wake-up call to someone else along with his call sign, then put the radio into a receive mode to listen for normal radio traffic, then start the coffee maker. It can also be used to automatically generate a distress call or dial a phone number through a phone patch and leave a message.
(4) Because the radio is designed for the visually impaired, wide use of voice prompts will have to be used. This radio will allow the user to program the voice in any language.

2140,"A FREAK ice storm that created lethal driving conditions led to the death of a driver, an inquest heard.
Aaron Frost, a 25-year-old kitchen fitter, was travelling home from work along the A27 at Emsworth on January 13 this year when he was caught in a hail storm that turned the road into a sheet of ice.
An inquest at Portsmouth Guildhall on Friday heard Aaron lost control of his BMW saloon and crashed into a concrete barrier at the side of the road.
The car then hit a lamppost and overturned before coming to rest on its side in a ditch, close to the onslip at Emsworth, just before the Shell garage.
The inquest heard Aaron was travelling back home to Bognor Regis, having worked in the Petersfield area.
He was chatting on a hands-free mobile phone with his best friend, Jake Gladwin.

Creating Dining Experiences Worth Sharing on Social Media
by David Mitroff, Ph.D. Founder & CEO, Piedmont Avenue Consulting, Inc.
More than ever today is about experiences, and people want to share their experiences. In order to run a successful restaurant, you must be able to create an experience for your customers. How are you making your restaurant shareable? What does the presentation of your food look like? The lighting? Does your restaurant have unique foods? What is different about your restaurant that makes your guests want to tell others about the experience? Below are some tips and examples you can use to ensure a positive, shareable experience at your restaurant.
Create a unique atmosphere:
Use decorations and aesthetics to create an environment your guests will remember and that will keep them coming back. You can create many different vibes with the way you choose to decorate and design your restaurant, such as romantic, cozy, or even one that matches the type of food you are serving. Providing guests with a comfortable, unique atmosphere will help your restaurant stand out and create a memorable experience for all.

2217,"Topic: CHMOD Newbie Craze
I have noticed alot of users (and I mean alot) think that CHMOD is always the answer, in fact not even 1% (maybe 2%
) of all problems can be resolved by CHMOD, let's take a minute to find out wat CHMOD is and what it does...
Firstly, all it does is tell what users can access files, it doesn't control code, so changing CHMOD will not make an error message dissapear, nor will it allow certains options to appear.
It is not related to PHP directly, they can 'communicate' but not in a conventional sense
Here is a problem that cannot be resolved by CHMOD:
Warning: main(X): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /www/site/folder on line #
Whereas this can:
Warning: fopen(X): failed to open stream: Permission denied in /www/site/folder on line #
So before posting answers such as:
Have you CHMOD the file?
Think how does it affect the problem in anyway due to permissions",What does CHMOD do and what kind of problems can it resolve?,"CHMOD tells what users can access files. It doesn't control code, so changing CHMOD will not make an error message disappear, nor will it allow certain options to appear.

- The BEST for your hands... Review by DBK
- My husband and I both have extremely dry hands in the winter time, and this is the only product we have found that works without making our hands greasy and grimy feeling. It's light, fragrance-free, and makes your hands feel totally soft and moisturized. (Posted on 4/6/15)

- Cannot live without it! Review by Beth
- Hands down one of the best hand creams you could use in those cold months. It 's fast absorbing, not greasy and has a light scent. I love that I can use it while I am driving and throw my hands right back onto the wheel because it absorbs THAT FAST!

- Fantastic product for dry SENSITIVE skin. Works great! (Posted on 7/2/13)
- Better Than a Prescription Review by illbbax
- 8 years ago, I took a position up north while I was living in Tampa, Florida. The skin on my hands would crack in the dry, cold winters of Dayton, Ohio.
I was close to going to a dermatologist for help; then a friend of mine was doing some Christmas shopping and I went along. She went to an apothecary and I asked if there was something I could put on my hands as a man, that would not have an un-masculine scent.
I was directed to the Quince Hand Lotion #007 and have used it religiously ever since. I am a believer in this product. Anyone who complains about the price, doesn't realize how long lasting the tube is, how well it works, and how much a comparable product would cost from a pharmaceutical company prescribed by a doctor or pharmacist.
If you're working on those new rigs in the Dakotas, try it, you'll love it. (Posted on 3/31/13)
- Only thing that work Review by Producer Bill
- I have dry hands, and I spend tons of time working with them however most hand lotions leave a greasy feeling. This doesn't and it heals my hands. Forget wondering if it will work. I am telling you right now it does and is well worth the cost. (Posted on 2/16/13)

- GREAT Review by butterfly6801
- I love this for hands, but even more than that I love it for my elbows. It keeps my elbows so soft, I have been out of it for about a month and my elbows really miss it. I can't wait until it's back in stock!!!!! (Posted on 1/16/13)
- Favorite lotion ever Review by Sam
- This is absolutely my favorite hand lotion ever, for two key reasons. First, it's silky and moisturizes really well, but unlike other effective moisturizers, it's not heavy or greasy. Most hand lotions either feel super-slippery or make your hands feel dirty afterwards because they're so heavy. This hits the Goldilocks zone.
Second, it has a fresh citrus-y smell that gives you a pick me up and then GOES AWAY. I'm not a huge scent person so don't like heavy, perfumed hand lotions that stay with you for ages. This is just enough to give a nice whiff of a refreshing scent while you're rubbing it in and then you can go back to your day.
So really, it's perfect. I actually go on and on about this lotion so much that once I was in the NY store at the counter and a woman behind me picked it up to look at it, and I started telling her how great it was until she decided to buy it. Because I had basically just sold a bottle of lotion, the sales lady who was ringing me up slyly put extra samples in my bag. So great lotion AND great store! (Posted on 6/1/12)

1766,"As a historian with specific interest in Agriculture and Economy, I have over the years focused on trying to proffer solutions to socio-economic problems confronting the Nigerian society in particular and the African continent in general. As a result much of my research works and publications have focused on issues like Land Management, Climate Change, Migration, Conflict, Crop production and marketing. Studies have also been done in areas of Ethno-Religious Conflict with focus on role of economy and governance, the Almajarai system and economic implications in Nigeria and Poverty and Terrorism. Some of these research outputs have been published as articles in reputable local and off-shore journals such as West Bohemian Historical Review, Developing Countries Studies, Modern Africa, Journal of Asian and African Studies and Historical Yearbook as well as chapters in books. These works have been able to impact not only on the academic community but also on the larger Nigerian Community and as such I have been at various times privileged to address much larger audience, both at intellectual and participatory levels. For instance, in 2010, I was invited by the Pan Igala Renaissance to speak on Trade and Commerce along the River Niger Basin. I have also worked with Center for Public Policy and Inter-religious Affairs on issues relating the socio-economic problems and possible solutions in Northern Nigeria. The work on Terrorism and its Implication on Infrastructure and Economic Development: A Review of Selected Cases across the Country since c.1980 published by Africa and Science, Germany, led to the body through her editor Moses Chi, requesting that I collaborate with one of their research who was then at the level of framework of research program on terrorism in Nigeria and Cameroun in 2015. The result of this led to my completion and subsequent publication of “Poverty and Terrorism in Northern Nigeria: Some Reflective notes on the manipulation of the almajirai System and its implication on National Development” in Modern Africa, Czech 2016 and “Emerging Religious Movements and its Implications for African History and Heritage”; European Scientific Journal, Republic of Macedonia 2016. In 2016, through my contribution in the area of intergroup relations, I was appointed member of the Study Committee on Inter-religious Affairs, Universal Peace Federation, West Africa and Nation Agricultural Production Cooperative Union of Nigeria (NAPCON). My research on the Economy, Minorities and Poverty in Northern Nigeria with specific reference to the Maguzawa and Nigeria citizenship: Reflecting on Identity Politics and National Question in Africa caught the attention of Nigerian Erosion and Watershed Management Project (NEWMAN) through which i was consulted to help work on Environment and Social Impact Assessment Study of Flood and Erosion, Northeastern Nigeria. I have consulted for the Kukah Centre Abuja, on Intergroup Relations, Conflict Prevention and Management in the Southern Kaduna area of Nigeria focusing on Economic Impact/Implications. I have also consulted for The Catholic Poverty Reduction Group in the area of History of the Marginalized Indigenous groups in Northern Nigeria. I am also a Resource Person and Contributor to the Nigerian History Project (NHP), a Centre under the auspices of the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library Foundation (OOPLF) for research, documentation and curation of galleries based on selected historical themes or events in Nigeria. As a way of mentoring, apart from my primary assignment in the University, I teach history as part of Community Development Project to pupils of Sunshine Primary School, Ile-Ife. I also reach out to the larger community through analysis on radio (Matters Arising on Odua FM 90.9 Ile-Ife and Crunch Time on Crown FM 101.5,Ile-Ife), articles and news in Independence Newspaper, Ibadan, Katolink Paper, Osogbo; The Olivebranch Newspaper, Zaria; The Cross News, Kaduna and The Caritas, Bauchi.",What are some of the socio-economic issues the historian has focused their research on in relation to Nigeria and Africa?,"The historian has focused their research on issues like Land Management, Climate Change, Migration, Conflict, Crop production and marketing, Ethno-Religious Conflict with focus on role of economy and governance, the Almajarai system and economic implications in Nigeria and Poverty and Terrorism."

148,"ANCHORAGE - A report issued Friday provides a wide-ranging look at Alaska Natives, including how the state's indigenous people are doing in areas of population, health, economics and education.
The report is an analysis of the Status of Alaska Natives Report 2004, which was prepared by the University of Alaska Anchorage's Institute of Social and Economic Research.
The report and analysis were requested by the Alaska Federation of Natives to bring new data to, and generate fresh ideas in, the Native community - and to increase dialogue with non-Natives.
""It is the first report that was done by Alaska Natives studying Alaska Natives,"" said Janie Leask, chairwoman of the board of trustees for the First Alaskans Institute. ""Applying Native thinking to Alaskan issues strengthens all of us in the end with a more unified, common vision.""
The Alaska Native Policy Center analyzed the data for the First Alaskans Institute, a nonprofit group helping Alaska Natives.

The report not only provides a snapshot of the status of Alaska Natives but also looks at trends over the past 15 years. The analysis concludes at least four areas need work simultaneously: improving public education, addressing health issues, creating jobs, and lowering the cost of living in rural Alaska.
Even in areas where there continue to be deficiencies, there also have been gains, said Greta Goto, director of the Alaska Native Policy Center. For example, there are more high schools but the dropout rate is troublesome, she said.
""I think it is a challenge we have to overcome,"" Goto said.
The report says since 1974, 155 new high schools have been built in Alaska, mainly in villages. And while 71 percent of Alaska Natives have high school diplomas now, up from 48 percent in 1980, the dropout rate almost doubled from 1998-2001.
The data show an increased migration of women and young people from rural villages to urban areas. The report says 58 percent of Alaska Natives still live in rural areas and 42 percent are in urban areas.
""More and more of our men are being left behind,"" said Carrie Brown, senior vice president of First Alaskans Institute.
If economic opportunities were increased and the cost of rural living reduced - especially energy costs - it would be possible for more Alaska Natives to stay in their villages and stop the ""brain drain,"" Brown said.
The report says 33 percent of unemployed Alaskans are Natives. Per capita income is $9,113 for Natives, compared with $18,819 for non-Natives.
The report found that significant gains have been made in health care. For example, 81 percent of Native children are getting immunized - a higher rate than in the rest of the United States. The life expectancy of Alaska Natives also increased from 46.4 years in 1950 to 69.5 years in 1997.
However, the data show that obesity among Natives is increasing, as well as teen birth rates, tobacco smoking and use of marijuana.
The report says the Native population stands at 119,241, or about 19 percent of Alaskans. If the population continues to grow at the current rate, there will be an estimated 140,000 Alaska Natives in 2010 and 165,000 in 2020.
With the median age a relatively young 24, it is important to consider what to do now to provide for a better future, Goto said.
""These resulting choices will impact how our future is shaped as a people and as a state,"" she said.",What are the four areas identified in the report that need simultaneous work for the improvement of Alaska Natives?,"The four areas identified in the report that need simultaneous work for the improvement of Alaska Natives are improving public education, addressing health issues, creating jobs, and lowering the cost of living in rural Alaska."
2382,"Netflix Caper Series 'Lupin' Returns For A Second Season This Summer
Lupin was the first surprise streaming hit of 2021, with its first five slick, super-fun episodes taking Netflix by storm. The crime caper series starring Omar Sy became the first French series to make the streamer's U.S. Top 10. But because of Netflix's weird release strategy (splitting up shows by ""Parts"" instead of seasons), we're left to wait to find out what happens next to Sy's master thief Assane Diop. And thankfully the wait won't be too long, with Lupin Part 2 set to hit Netflix this summer.
Netflix announced that Part 2 of the French crime thriller series Lupin will debut on the streaming service in Summer 2021. The five new episodes will be directed by Ludovic Bernard (The Climb), who directs episodes 6 and 7, and Hugo Gélin (Love at second sight), who takes on episodes 8, 9, and 10.
Sy is set to reprise his role as Assane Diop, a master criminal driven to a life of thievery to get revenge on the people who framed his Senegalese immigrant father for a crime he didn't commit. Naturally, he bases his heists on the exploits of the fictional gentleman thief Arsène Lupin. Also starring in Part 2 are Hervé Pierre, Nicole Garcia, Clotilde Hesme, Ludivine Sagnier, Antoine Gouy, Shirine Boutella,Soufiane Guerrab.
I'm a fan of Lupin hiring notable French filmmakers to direct the episodes — the Transporter director Louis Leterrier helmed the first three episodes of the series — as it helps Lupin maintain its sense of style and panache. I tore through the first five episodes of Lupin, which is a wonderfully frothy little caper that finally gave star Omar Sy his due, after years of the The Intouchables breakout being wasted by Hollywood in forgettable supporting roles. The actual heists are a ton of fun too, and it's exciting to see what kind of twisty escapades they have in store for us in Part 2.
Created by George Kay in collaboration with François Uzan and produced by Gaumont Télévision, Lupin is the latest international hit to come from Netflix, which has been aggressively expanding its global outreach, often resulting in lots of foreign-language gems getting buried in the algorithm. Lupin, thankfully, did not suffer that fate, and is deservedly getting a lot of attention after becoming the first French series to break into the U.S. Top 10 list (taking No. 1 in at least 10 countries, per Netflix).
There's no concrete release date yet for the next part, but check out the teaser art for Lupin Part 2 below.

1620,"Whenever I go to My Stats, it’s embarrassing for me to see myself as the first among the top commenter. For the record, all my comments are replies to audiences who cared to comment. So what I did is to transfer almost all my own comments by embedding each one of them inside the responses of my dear readers. I just got that trick from a few bloggers. Initially from 54, it’s now trimmed down to just 15 comments.
Familiarity breeds contempt
There’s a saying that familiarity breeds contempt. Maybe that’s the reason why most of my blog audiences are strangers. But that’s okay since most of my friends started as strangers first before I came to know them better. But later on, maybe their interest of knowing you better is waning. My friends and colleagues might be too familiar with me now. Maybe I’m just thinking too much.
I think it only reflects that I never take all readers for granted. I don’t like the feeling of being ignored, that’s why I always make it a point that I give an immediate feedback to readers. I appreciate all kinds of comments excluding spam comments, though I bother to read them sometimes. Like the motto of the captain from The Five People You Meet in Heaven, I see to it that no one gets left behind. I love to read comments because it inspires me to write more whenever someone gives their opinion.
Spam Comments
A few hours after I posted this entry, I was shocked to see an overwhelming number 40 spam comments queuing in this post alone. Wow!
yes, i think you’re thinking too much. i’m sometimes amazed when i see certain blogs that have 40-50 comments on their posts. i barely get any comments, and that’s okay because – for me – it’s not about the comments. it’s about me getting my thoughts out, saying what i have to say, and practicing my use of language. i’m not trying to be a journalist – which is what blogging is kinda like. i’m want to write books. blogging allows me to practice. it allows me to get thoughts and issues out of my head, and it helps me keep in the habit of writing. i, and millions of others, think i have brilliants novels waiting to be written. but sometimes i have other ideas in the way, ideas about politics, social observations, kids, work, etc. and sometimes i can’t work on the book i want to write until these other bothersome thoughts are out of the way.
i would love all those followers that i see on other blogs. i see people with over 100 followers, and i wonder how the hell that happens. i would love the comments that others get because it would help me feel like i’m really connecting with people. but i also know that most of those other blogs have a very specific and limited theme or subject area. that’s not what i’m doing. i can’t focus on one thing, like photography or cooking. i have to write about whatever the hell comes up, and that’s not going to bring me a specific audience that will come back day after day.
so, write for you. not for them.
Whenever I write, I see to it that my writing voice is the same with the manner how I talk. So it ends up being conversational. I have a lot of unpublished posts here maybe because I’m just thinking too much just like you’ve said.
I see that you’re into writing books and self-publishing. That’s great.
So in writing for myself, I’ll consider it. Thanks!
I don’t think you should worry so much about that. It just means that you are diligent at replying to comments (which is a good thing). No one sees the stats but you.
Now I’ll continue replying to every comments and try to lessen being conscious of it.
Thanks for dropping by. 🙂
Well, Allen jambalaya, you know how I post, ahahaha ! Too conversational. And guess what, that’s my line of thought. Always. I’m topicless ! !
Just write ! And write for yourself !
Hahaha! That’s what you call randomness. 🙂
Okay, okay. I get it now. Its just that writing for myself sounds selfish but I’ll try it. I’ll write for the sake of writing itself.
Cheers!
Spam comments are my online pet peeve. Shocked me when an article about my love for grandma has apparently helped someone sell drugs like Viagra and the likes. But thank God for Akismet.
Thanks for subscribing back, Allen. And yeah, just write away!
The lesson here is to moderate comments. Even one or two comments sometimes slips from the spam detection. But nonetheless, Akismet always saves the day.
I don’t think there’s an issue with being the top commenter of your own blog. It’s your blog, after all. It’s not as if you’re chatting with yourself. it just means you’re replying to comments.
Also, when you reply to commenters by just adding your response to their original comment, they may not get to read it because the system doesn’t get a notification that a new comment is added.
Spam comments are annoying but some are funny as hell.
Spam comments are giving me a hard time now. Because of the spam comments, I’m not receiving notifications on my e-mail now whenever someone leaves a comment. My reply to one of the comments even landed on the spam section and it took me some time to notice it! But rarely, some are just random trolls and give comments just for the lols.

- Empire State New York manufacturing survey drops by the most ever
- A reading of U.S. home-builder confidence falls
- Sotheby’s shares jump nearly 60% after report says auction house is set to be taken private
U.S. stocks closed higher Monday on the back of strong gains in social media and entertainment shares such as Facebook Inc. and Netflix Inc., as investors await the Federal Reserve’s policy-setting meeting due to start Tuesday,
How did major indexes fare?
The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.09% rose 22.92 points to 26,112.53, supported by Boeing Co. BA, +2.23% which gained 2.2%. The S&P 500 indexSPX, +0.09% climbed 2.69 points to 2,889.67 as social media, entertainment and real estate stocks rallied. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.62% added 48.37 points, or 0.6%, to 7,845.02.
What drove the market?
The Federal Reserve will be the focus this week with markets pricing in more than two interest rate cuts this year on fears of the fallout from global trade tensions and a slowdown in the economy. Investors will want to see if those expectations match up to what the Fed is thinking, though no move on interest rates is expected at this week’s meeting.
A survey of manufacturing activity in the New York state area showed its largest-ever drop into negative territory in June. The Empire State manufacturing index plummeted 26.4 points to negative 8.6 in June, a record decline. Economists had expected a reading of positive 10, according to a survey by Econoday.
Any reading below zero indicates a contraction in activity. The last time the index was negative was in October 2016.
A reading from the National Association of Home Builders survey for June showed that home-builder confidence fell two points to 64 in June, missing economists’ consensus forecast of a one-point increase. Any reading over 50 signals improvement.
On the global trade front, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross played down the likelihood of a major deal at the Group of 20 summit later this month, even if President Donald Trump and China President Xi Jinping meet. The most likely outcome will be an agreement for the U.S. and China to keep talking, he told The Wall Street Journal in an interview.
Separately, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative is holding seven days of public hearings on the Trump administration’s proposal to raise a 25% levy on $300 billion of Chinese exports, including consumer goods such as mobile phones and laptops.

“The past few days managed little to no real progress for bulls nor bears, and by Friday’s close, S&P was less than a half point away from were prices had closed Monday. This coming week brings about the much anticipated June [Federal Open Market Committee] meeting, and while a lowering of rates has not been priced in by the market for Tuesday, such a move is expected by July, and failure to do so would be a surprise to markets (based on current positioning),” wrote Mark Newton, technical analyst at Newton Advisors, in a research note.

Mathys Kauffmann of Kriegstetten, Solothurn, Switzerland, was one of the Anabaptist preachers held in chains in the newly built penitentiary and orphanage in Bern, who were considered ""the most important preachers and ringleaders"" (see Bern). From 3 March 1659 to 10 September 1660, Kauffmann was there. Efforts of the council and the clergy to convert him were in vain. On 20 January 1660 the appointed persons ""betook themselves to the Anabaptist business"" in the penitentiary to give the Anabaptists an examination. On 16 points the prisoners had to give an account, covering doctrine, communion, baptism, and attitude to government. All remained true to their convictions. Kauffmann had been seized at Koppingen in the canton of Bern, at his daughter's home. Now he besought the council to release him because he wanted to go to Solothurn. According to a decision of the council of 15 June 1660, the prisoners were to be banished. On 27 August they were again cross-examined, but they still ""persisted in their opinion, no matter what one tried with them."" Kauffmann was then taken to the border via Brügg with the others on 10 September 1660 and banished.

If any of the above sounds like something you may have felt or thought, welcome to the reality of our humanity. How we move forward will depend on our relationship with the Lord. We serve a wonderful, loving, patient Lord Jesus who is human as well as divine, and has been touched with every emotional feeling and heartache that any of us could every experience.
Not only has He “been there and done that,” He overcame and walked out with the victory. It’s the enemy of our faith who interferes with our thinking and counters with the thought, “hath God said,” about all that we “know” about the grace and mercy of our Savior. When our feelings are telling us one thing and the Word tells us another, we are the ones who need to make a deliberate choice.
The enemy loves to make you think that someone else is more spiritual that you are. Jesus is no respecter of persons. The faintest thought or cry is loud and clear to His waiting ear and heart. Praise God, He also translates our confused and mix-up thoughts and words into what our heart is trying to express. I find that I need to go back to worship and reconnect with the Holy Spirit who will lead me into all truth and or repentance (if necessary) and mend the emotional disconnect.
Why wouldn’t the One who loves you most not want you to share your innermost thoughts and concerns? “Come unto Me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” Matt.11:28 KJ

1385,"Case Studies
The following three case studies illustrate common problem types that ACDL has worked on for people with disabilities in New South Wales. All case studies have been de-identified.
CASE STUDY 1 – Assistance Animals
Maria has diabetes, depression, anxiety, agoraphobia and chronic back pain. Two years ago, her GP recommended that she get an assistance dog to assist with her disabilities. Maria has trained her dog to be a diabetic alert dog, so he can let her know if her blood sugar is crashing, and she also finds that her dog greatly assists her with her other disabilities via companionship, increased physical movement and general comfort.
Maria bought an apartment in a strata complex last year, and notified the strata manager that she had an assistance dog. The strata manager said it shouldn’t be a problem but she would need to submit an application to the body corporate. She did so prior to moving in and provided supporting documents from her doctor highlighting how the dog alleviated her disabilities. She also provided information on the level of training the dog had been given. However, the Strata manager said she could not keep the dog as she had not provided sufficient information about his accreditation, and therefore Maria had to be apart from her dog for some months.
After obtaining documents and consider Maria’s matter, ACDL wrote a letter to the Strata manager on Maria’s behalf, explaining that her dog satisfies the requirements disability discrimination legislation as the dog is trained to alleviate her disability and trained to an appropriate standard in a public place, and that Maria would be bringing her dog onto the property as at that date. Maria was then able to bring her dog onto the property with confidence.
CASE STUDY 2 – Education
Omar is a 13 year old student in Year 7 at a public school. He has autism, ADHD, ODD and anxiety, and has a behavioural management plan in place. Due to his disabilities, he often acts out in a silly or joking manner, including swearing, and he often lashes out physically when distressed, which is why his behavioural management plan focuses on ways to calm him down. The school follows a strict discipline policy for anything that is seen as misbehaviour: any student who swears or engages in any physical altercation of any level is automatically suspended for 2 days, and progressively longer suspensions occur for each new breach of behaviour.
Omar experienced increasingly long suspensions throughout year 7 for minor incidents of physical altercation with other students as a result of bullying, firstly for 2 days, then 4 days, then 5 days, culminating in a 20 day suspension for appearing to threaten a teacher. The teacher and other students interpreted this as clowning around rather than a genuine threat and the situation was quickly defused. The incident was not even mentioned by his teacher to his parents until the suspension occurred some days later. His mother repeatedly requested that the discipline and suspension policy be amended to take into account Omar’s tendency to act out inappropriately, and institute alternative forms of discipline in accordance with his behavioural management plan, such as detention or similar. The School did not do so, and after the last long suspension, Omar was again found to be misbehaving and was threatened with expulsion. the School had failed to make reasonable adjustments which would accommodate his disabilities despite repeated requests. ACDL explained the process and options for making a discrimination complaint, as well as providing referrals for assistance with challenging the procedural decision to expel him on other grounds. Omar’s mother said that she found the advice very helpful and allowed her to consider all her options clearly.
CASE STUDY 3 – Employment
Danielle was diagnosed with Hepatitis C. She worked at an accounting firm and did not tell them about it when she got the job. She was worried about what they would think and she did not think that her diagnosis would affect the way she did her job.
One day, she told a close workmate. When she came to work the next day, she found that her workmate had told other people. After lunch, there was a note on her desk calling her a ‘druggie’.
Danielle was really upset. After a few days, she decided to ask for a meeting with her employer to tell her what had happened. Danielle’s employer seemed shocked to hear about the behaviour of the others but was worried that if he said something it might cause conflict within the team. He said he would say something to the other employees, but kept putting off actually doing so.
Danielle approached ACDL for advice. ACDL told her that she might have a complaint of disability discrimination or harassment under the law, but Danielle did not want to make a complaint at this point in time. ACDL wrote a letter detailing the requirements under disability discrimination law and asking the employer to resolve the matter swiftly.
Upon receiving the letter, Danielle’s employer called an urgent staff meeting to discuss the importance of a safe work place and the policy on harassment and discrimination. Danielle’s complaint was then dealt with in accordance with the workplace grievance policy and the situation was resolved.",What actions did ACDL take to help Maria keep her assistance dog in her apartment?,"ACDL wrote a letter to the Strata manager on Maria’s behalf, explaining that her dog satisfies the requirements of disability discrimination legislation as the dog is trained to alleviate her disability and trained to an appropriate standard in a public place.

1322,"The newest craze in the more than extravagant world of art investment is blockchain-based NFT art objects. Powered by the cryptocurrency hype of the last few months, more and more artists discovered a way to sell digital art with blockchain-technology. And where money and tech meet, Adult Entertainment is not far. As it turns out, many performers and adult artists are already at the forefront of the upcoming NFT boom.
While most people still are skeptical of cryptocurrencies and a majority still doesn’t even really know how to even buy bitcoins, the hype at the crypto markets did lead to an increasingly accelerating development of additional uses of the blockchain-technology. Digital artists found a way to make their artworks unique by transforming them into so-called»non-fungible tokens« on the blockchain. Basically, they found a way to circumvent the problem all digital-forms have: they can be copied and hence there would not be an original as in traditional art forms. An NFT can exist once, making the artwork or picture or movie or whatever you transform into an NFT the equivalent of an original that then can be sold at a higher price.
Recently the artist Mike Winkelman (Bleeple) made headlines with a Jpg he created and sold for nearly 70 million dollars through the famous auction house Christie’s. But that was not a singular moment, shortly before he sold an NFT video clip for nearly 7 million dollars. Not only art but also strange other digital »objects« get the NFT treatment. F.ex. Twitter founder Jack Dorsey auctioned off his very first tweet or a digital NFT of that very tweet.
Adult Entertainment again a driving force for new technology?
As with VHS and the Internet, streaming platforms, torrents, and subscription-based websites, adult entertainment is already an active driver of the NFT movement which up until now might only be a short-lived hype. But if adult performers, artists, and sex workers find ways to make NFTs a way of stable income, that would probably mean that NFTs are here to stay and become common-place.
Rolling Stone Magazine published an article about several adult performers and femdom producers that started to use NFT to make money. They tell story of a woman calling herself Cryptonatrix selling digital images of Silicon Valley capitalists like Elon Musk and Vladimir Tenev (the CEO of Robinhood) in BDSM-related scenarios where she is dominating the seemingly powerful man. One of her pictures sold for nearly 2,000 dollars.
Owning unique art objects
Cryptonatrix refers to her digital art as »commentary on political or social happenings with femdom themes« and hence is targeting the art market. But it’s easy to imagine other forms of usage of the NFT technology in adult entertainment. Especially for content creators already successful on clip sites (as many femdom artists and custom porn producers are) can cash in on their fans desire to own unique pictures, videos and hence very authentic, private, rare digital objects of their stars.
No censorship, no piracy: A perfect business model for porn?
The cryptocurrency-based NFT platforms might also be a good way to circumvent censorship and shadow-banning problems many adult entertainment professionals encounter when they try to use traditional banking services and payment processors. Paypal still is famous for its refusal to process adult business transactions.
The adult performer Allie Eve Knox f.ex. is offering a fetish and kink piece called »Allie in the City, Two,” in which she is depicted as a giantess towering over Madrid’s famous Edificio Metropolis. Before that, she successfully sold »Allie in the City, One,« for over $500.
About the advantages the new technology might offer adult entertainment creators, she said: »In the old Limewire days, people were just downloading shit because they could, because we trained people to believe that it was so easy and available you could get it anywhere. Training people to buy art or music or nudes is a good step in sex workers’ direction because it encourages someone to invest their money in individualized, exclusive content. It’s training people to pay for their porn.«
Porn Studio releases one of its hit movies as NFT
One of the legendary porn site brands Wasteland.com has now announced the release of its first award-winning porn film available as an NFT. AVN reports on the new way of using a website’s catalog: »Wasteland’s newly released NFTs features Raven Riley and Liz Vicious from the horror porn feature, Succubus—a full-length motion picture that was produced in 2005-07 in Dayton, Ohio—with never-before-released footage of the two performers.«
Wasteland owner and co-founder, Colin Rowntree, said about his experiment on the new market: »I find NFT fascinating as a technology and distribution medium. At a time when the unfettered piracy of adult content has absolutely cratered the perceived value of porn as a product, NFTs are an intriguing, emerging means of reinjecting some value through real scarcity.«
Risky costs and the unpredictable future of the blockchain
But as with many of the new technologies, there are downsides and insecurities as well. F.ex. right now, NFTs can only be created on the blockchain used by Ethereum. And so-called gas fees which are Ethereum processing fees make it quite risky to create an NFT. And due to the highly volatile market price of crypto-currencies like Ethereum the costs and benefits are difficult to predict. Additionally, as with all internet platforms, growing success and growing audiences might mean that platforms selling NFTs might also start to censor content, just like social media platforms and payment processors did in the past.
And right now age verification is also not addressed. Cryptonatrix said: »You don’t know the age of the buyer or who’s in the content, or how old the person is or if they gave consent for that. So that’s a huge concern of mine.«
For the moment though, the new technology is creating a new rush and a highly innovative push for new ways of creating and selling content. And there is no question: Adult entertainment will play a huge role in its success or ultimate fizzling out.
If you want to know more about the technology and what is needed to created NFT artworks, here is a tutorial and some background information by digital artist Aaron Rutten.",What is the new trend in the art investment world that is powered by the cryptocurrency hype?,The new trend in the art investment world that is powered by the cryptocurrency hype is blockchain-based NFT art objects.

Actually, you can do both. In fact, the spinnier the serve, the easier it is to keep short.
Nearly every coach will tell you to first learn to serve with great spin. Holding back on the spin so you can serve short is a good way to develop a bad habit. When you can get great spin on the ball, then you learn to serve short - but this happens automatically. To get maximum spin, you need to whip the racket into the ball at full speed (using the arm to get the playing hand moving, and snapping the wrist into the ball just before contact) but barely graze the ball. Nearly all of the energy from your arm and wrist goes into spin. When that happens, the ball barely comes off the racket - and so it is easy to keep the ball short. Those who have difficulty serving short with spin are having trouble mostly because they are not grazing the ball finely enough - and so the solution isn't to serve with less spin; it's to serve with more spin by grazing the ball more.
The other reason a spinny serve might go long is the contact point is too high, which also leads to the serve being too high. Once you are grazing the ball very finely, you need to learn to serve it low with a low contact point, and learn where to bounce it on each side of the table for varying depths. If you barely graze the ball, you'll not only maximize the spin but since nearly all your energy is going into spin, you'll find yourself almost struggling to get the ball to reach and go over the net - which is a good thing. It means the serve will be short and spinny.
The ideal spin serve will, if given the chance, bounce twice on the opponent's side of the table, with the second bounce as close to the endline as possible. Sometimes a super-short serve is effective (which might bounce three or more times on the opponent's side, given the chance), as it forces the opponent to reach well over the table, but super-short serves are also easier to flip, push short, or quick-push at an angle. Many players use ""tweeny"" serves, where the second bounce is right around the endline, and the receiver is never quite sure if it will come off the end or not.
Once you have a true spin serve that you can serve short, that's when I'd recommend adding no-spin serves as a variation, and focusing on keeping this and the spin serves very low, with the second bounce near the endline. Serving no-spin when there's little threat of spin isn't as effective after the first few times. No-spin becomes far more effective when it can be done with a spin motion, when there's a threat of spin. (How do you serve no-spin with a spin motion? Several ways, but primarily by contacting the ball near the handle, where the racket travels slowly even in a vigorous serve.) A no-spin serve with a vigorous motion is called ""heavy no-spin."" Seriously!
It's easier to serve short backspin or no-spin than to serve short sidespin or topspin, or various combinations of these two. So many players fall into the habit of serving just backspin or no-spin when they want to serve short. This greatly limits their options, and makes things a lot easier for the opponent. Well-disguised backspin and no-spin serves are effective, but they are often even more effective if you can throw sidespin and topspin serves into the mix.
At the beginning/intermediate level, I recommend a player who has difficulty serving short with spin to add a simple short backspin serve, with the focus on keeping the ball low with as much backspin as possible while still keeping the ball short. This simple backspin serve should be a temporary serve, used only so the player doesn't spend all his time serve & blocking. (Also, since most players will push it back long, you get to practice your serve and loop a lot.) Roughly speaking, by the time a player is 1800, a well-coached player should be able to serve with good spin and keep it short. By the time he's 2000, he should have varied spin serves that go short. By the time he's 2200 he should have varied and deceptive serves that go short. (He should also be able to do all this with long serves.)
But you don't have to wait until you're 1800, or 2000, or 2200 to do these things. There are many examples of players who really worked at their serves early on (both short and long), and were able to compete with ""stronger"" players because of this - and because of that stronger competition, they improved faster. Why not you?",What is the ideal spin serve in table tennis?,"The ideal spin serve will, if given the chance, bounce twice on the opponent's side of the table, with the second bounce as close to the endline as possible."

1752,"2017 Information Management Symposium – Summary
This turning insight into action, as summed up by Jeff Cribbs of Gartner describes the road ahead for data analysis in the health insurance industry. Trends in this year’s discussions were artificial intelligence, curated data visualization and aligning business with technology and government partnerships to source the right data.
Following are highlights from several of the discussions:
Data Visualization Keynote – Audrey Halvorson and Raji Dasari told a story about how adopting Tableau reduced IT costs for generating reports and data visualizations and provided the customer and provider with a 360-degree experience.
Customer Experience Backbone Keynote – Cindy Montgomery and Garrett Anderson put forward a new system architecture that incorporates artificial intelligence into the data analysis process. They demonstrated how a banner in their online member portal would be displayed based on the persona that the AI would associate to the member. The banner would provide a link to further information tailored to the member. He foresees integrating the Customer Experience Backbone and AI with chatbots and other interactive tools.
Member Information: The Big Picture – Brent Leland from BCBSKC talked about the importance of a good member patient index algorithm to reduce operating costs by automatically matching data records and alleviate manual data processing. Marco Weixler from ICW, who partnered with BCBSKC on the project, developed an engine based on a statistical model to automate the matching process.
Medication Reconciliation Provider Data Enablement – Allison Combs and Louis Polite presented the business and technical perspectives of BCBSM’s achievements to integrate with the MiHIN member data feed. MiHIN is a state-wide network for routing health records between interested parties. They have a publish & subscribe model and a security model for dealing with sensitive information. By integrating with the MiHIN network, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan will improve its data to offer competitive pharmacy services benefits, wellness and care management intervention benefits, and medical reconciliation programs. We look forward to hearing an update next year on the evolution of the system.
Leveraging Key Indicators to Drive Benefit Decisions – Timothy Donald presented the BCBSNJ configuration of Tableau to help with the sales process and drive the decision process.
Gartner Keynote – Jeff Cribbs presented a vision of the future of the healthcare insurance industry. A thought-provoking presentation, Jeff proposed the Health Value Management Organization (HVMO) – a transformation in the industry towards proving improved health value to the customer. The areas targeted for innovation were artificial intelligence in health IT, a member engagement hub, economics of connection and the Internet of Things like home health monitoring.
The Jonah Group team shared with attendees some of our recent work with Michigan Health Insurance providers.
- Built for a leading IPA in Michigan, HealthFocus is a web application that allows practitioners to manage patient care, their measures, and provider compliance rates & goals. The application is fully integrated with the host’s existing data warehouse.
- Also built for the data warehouse is a pair of critical processing engines. The first provides a master patient reference with heuristics for cleansing, merging, and matching duplicate and near-duplicate patient data from disparate and volatile external data feeds. The second is a HEDIS measure and conditions engine for calculation of compliance rates across a range of over one hundred different measures and across hundreds of practice offices.
With data analytics and big data being a common theme, Jonah Group’s work with AMD was of interest. We designed, built and implemented a big data system on Hadoop.
The symposium board members did a great job lining up interesting talks, facilitating good networking opportunities and providing fun entertainment. The event was a great success!

184,"For the Reporter-Herald
This can be a wonderful season of the year, when families come together, friendships are rekindled, and the hope for peace is everywhere. But unfortunately, for some people, there can also be the a-a-choo that seems to come with the season.
Sneezing, sinus congestion, fatigue — it could just be the common cold, but researchers recently pointed to a surprising possible cause for the uptick in allergy like symptoms that is seen over the holidays. And aghast, the culprit may be one of the most beloved symbols of the season: the Christmas tree.
In the Annals of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, researchers from the State University of New York noted that ""respiratory illnesses peak around Christmas.""
""Within two weeks of putting a tree up, you can experience symptoms due to either the smell of pine resin in 'live' trees or various molds found in the trees,"" wrote American Family Care (AFC), a national health care system of urgent and family care facilities.
In the past, physicians and researchers had thought that the rise in cold-like symptoms over the holidays were ""sparked by tree pollen and weed killer applied to trees,"" according to AFC.
In 2011, the State University researchers noted that the trigger was more likely the, ""molds found in live Christmas trees."" In fact, 70 percent of the molds on the trees were suspect.
The American Christmas Tree Association (ACTA) notes that because most trees for purchase, ""are harvested well in advance of Christmas and stored in moist holding areas prior to settling in your home, undesirable mold spores have time to develop and grow. When you bring one of these live trees inside, these same microscopic spores that usually float freely outdoors, float freely in the enclosed sanctuary of your home. Floating molds create an atmosphere that can make someone with allergies quite susceptible to asthma and increasing sinus issues,"" wrote ACTA.
But before you decide to haul your tree to the recycling center, AFC and ACTA offer several things you can do to lessen the chances of what is referred to as Christmas Tree Syndrome.
Both organizations recommend washing off the tree and letting it dry before bringing it into the home. That idea might not always be feasible in changing Colorado where temperature could turn your efforts into natural icicles on the branches. But on warmer days, this is a positive option for removing mold spores from the tree.
Wearing gloves and a long-sleeved shirt as you bring the tree inside can also help. This can keep you from touching sap, which contains terpene and other substances that can irritate skin and mucous membranes, noted ACTA.
Dr. Johnny Shen, a board-certified physician with American Family Care's Doctors Express, an urgent and family care center in Cherry Creek, notes that they do see an increase in the number of patients coming in with allergy type symptoms during the Christmas season.
""But we don't immediately chock it up to Christmas Tree Syndrome. For the most part it wouldn't be the first thing we think of,"" said Shen. He pointed to the importance of getting a good history before determining the cause. ""There's a list of questions we might ask. 'Have you been exposed to mold dust? Have you been up in the mountains? If you get closer to the tree does your wheezing or other symptoms increase?""
Shen cautions against self-diagnosing. ""Go see a doctor if you have shortness of breath. If you have a fever, make sure it's not an infection — you may have a bacterial infection that needs to be treated.""
If it is determined that you most likely do have an allergic reaction to Christmas trees, there are some things you can do that may help. To avoid molds, avoid trees that have been cut and stored for some time. A freshly cut tree may work better for you. If you are allergic to pine oil or pine pollen (conifer pollen), then the freshly cut ones may cause you more problems.
""If you have allergies, maintain good air flow by using an air purifier,"" suggested Shen. ""We'd recommend not keeping your tree longer than four to seven days in the house.""
Before you rush out and decide to purchase an artificial tree, be aware that they can also induce allergic reactions, usually from dust. Remember to cover your artificial tree and store it to avoid excessive dust. When you pull it out for the new season, take a moment to wipe it down.
For those who are prone to allergies, taking a few precautions can help them enjoy the beauty of their Christmas tree and avoid the discomfort of Christmas Tree Syndrome.",What is a possible cause for the increase in allergy-like symptoms during the holiday season?,A possible cause for the increase in allergy-like symptoms during the holiday season is the molds found in live Christmas trees.
1633,"Some of the stress that came out in my previous post has been dealt with now. Or at least a plan has been made for dealing with it. So that's good.
This morning I took stock of my proto-job-talk and the net result of my latest research binge. The proto-job-talk is actually in decent shape. Talking about my work in a different part of the country is going to require some additional information to be conveyed in the background sections, but I don't think I have to change much in terms of slides. And I am starting to identify some key graphs and results from my recent work that I'd like to talk about. Now I just have to get them looking pretty, be really sure of what they're telling me, and make sure I understand their context. Then I've got to figure out how to integrate them into the narrative arc of my talk. And then, practice, practice, practice...tinker, tinker....practice, practice, practice.

Glad to hear you're feeling better about your job talk! Good luck with the coming interview (and the in-laws).
We just finished a round of interviews for a permanant curator position at the museum. Amazingly, all three interviewees were women in the early stages of their careers - all with phds and postdoc experience. As a postdoc, myself, I paid close attention to their talks and interpersonal skills. I thought I would give a brief list of observations/advise to inspire you, Science Woman.
1. Enthusiasm goes a long way. Be sure to exude excitement for your own research as well as the ideas of your potential colleagues.
2. While they suggest that you give a general science audience talk, don't dumb it down. Present the real science and how it is important. Make the slides clear and present them clearly.
3. Be sure your science doens't neglect the complications in your research. Admit the short falls to your research and be willing to hear new ideas or brianstorm ideas for how to address the problems. Nobody's perfect and sometimes it takes a lot of different kinds of experiments to come up with a final answer.
4. Be interested in other people in the department. Introduce yourself and find out who everyone is. People will be flattered by your interest.
5. Have a good idea of what it will take for you to be successful at the insitution. What supplies, lab space will you need. Try to come up with a dollar amount for critical lab supplies. Also, have a good idea of where future funding will come from, even if you haven't been a PI yet.
6. Have a very good answer for the question ""Why do you want to come here?"" The answer should not be ""because I hate where I am now"" or ""because I don't know where to go after I graduate."" Focus on the positive aspects of the department - the location for future field work, the facilities, the people, the range of students, teaching.
7. Have confindence in yourself. Others can read it in your posture or speech patterns. Effervesce your intellect and special qualities.
GOOD LUCK! You rock, Science Woman! I'll be in touch.

217,"REVIEW: History of Wolves by Emily Fridlund
HISTORY OF WOLVES by Emily Fridlund is a coming-of-age story about a young girl who struggles to live within poverty with ex-hippies as parents in northern Minnesota. When she begins babysitting for the neighbors across the lake, she starts to feel a part of something bigger than herself. Until she witnesses and allows a terrible thing that will shape her life.
The rambling style of the main character’s thoughts is addictive, even though it left me perplexed quite often. I loved the descriptions of the woods and nature. The author’s words illustrated the love and appreciation of the wild. I feel as if I’ve lived a childhood similar, running off through the woods in the 1960s because my parents needn’t worry about my safety. I wish I could have given that happy, carefree, childhood bliss of the innocent to my own children. But that unique world was too far gone by the time I became a parent. This novel’s descriptions make me wish for simpler times.
Overall, I enjoyed the book, except for the sexual connotations that felt like they were coming from an abused individual. Linda showed no evidence of abuse, but she was very imbalanced in her thinking, often coming off as a sociopath. This isn’t always a comfortable book to read. I wonder if her deviant thoughts are used as a metaphor or simile to explain something that happened, or that she assumed or wished happened. At times, I felt these odd thoughts were placed for shock value to heighten anticipation. Since this story is mostly about growing up with ex-hippie parents and unusual friends and neighbors, the strangeness of the main character’s thoughts can be explained. But many times, I wondered if she was on the brink of a manic episode. Linda has an eerie, strange voice that’s captivating and addicting.
My only disappointment is that I didn’t understand the final chapter, even after re-reading the last few chapters several times. I feel like I should understand it and I have some guesses, but I’m left wondering what I missed. This seems like one of those literary books that everyone will rave about but I won’t understand without discussing within a group. The other half of me is offended that I don’t get it and now I wonder what I missed.
I had a very hard time coming up with a rating for this book because of the final chapter. The end leaves me with so many questions and disappointment. I’m not sure if I’m disappointed in myself because I don’t get it, or in the author because it isn’t clear. For that reason alone, I could rate this book a 3 but it doesn’t do it justice. For the bulk of the book that’s wondrously talented, plus my eager enjoyment, I’d rate it 4.5 to a 5, so I’ve compromised with a 4. It leaves me with the belief that each reader’s mileage will vary. My hope is that more of my friends will try this book so we can figure it out together!
Originally attracted to the title and the cover, this story wasn’t like anything I expected. The significance of the title confused me until the end when I realized what affect one moment early in her childhood had on Linda’s life. Beyond what the title means to the main character, I believe HISTORY OF WOLVES represents a family nucleus as a pack of wolves. Yes, the mother and father are near, but there are far more influences on this adolescent’s life that flow into adulthood. I’ll always wonder about her story twenty years into the future. Will she always wander as a lone wolf?
Author Emily Fridlund writes in a literary style that rambles eloquently, but in the same manner as human thoughts, zigzagging across several subjects at once. An articulate and creative author to watch, I’m super curious about her next endeavor. In the HISTORY OF WOLVES, simple paragraphs are lifted with a vision, as words become thoughts that engage and tease the reader. The beauty of each sentence is captivating. I could get lost for hours reading and re-reading pages of this book. If you love the written word, read this book for the author’s expressive sentences that transport. Emily Fridlund creates evocative storytelling in a haunting debut.

Umno’s image is in shreds, but does Zahid Hamidi care?
COMMENT
Violence apparently comes easy to Umno politicians and those associated with them, as they have illustrated so many times in words and deeds.
Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, said to be one of the Umno president’s most trusted lieutenants, obviously does not care that the public thinks so lowly of his party or that his outrageous defence of blood-spilling thugs serves only to deepen our suspicion of his being a violent man himself, as alleged in a suit brought a few years ago by businessman Amir Abdullah Bazli.
Amir said Zahid allegedly administered punches on his face in public in 2006, leaving him with a fractured nose and swollen eye. Zahid denied the allegations and applied for the case to be dismissed, which finally happened in 2010.
He then decided to counter-sue Amir, citing humiliation and emotional trauma as a result of the accusation.
Thankfully, the Court of Appeal in 2012 had the wisdom to rule against Zahid’s bid to strike out the assault suit. The three judges in the panel ordered him to pay RM5,000 in costs and respond to the action.
Amir’s suit was eventually settled out of court at the end of last year.
But despite claiming to have been traumatised by the smear on his alleged reputation, Zahid seems not to have learned his lesson.
How else can we explain his apparent refusal to chastise the group that wants violence done on one of his political opponents?
Indeed the tone of his statement on the matter indicated that he was all for Teresa Kok being slapped in the face for allegedly insulting Muslims with her video, as if the Prime Minister and his wife represent Islam.
Zahid told reporters it was unnecessary for the authorities to investigate Kok’s allegation of harassment by the Council of Islamic NGOs.
He has instead ordered the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission to investigate complaints made against Kok over her satirical Chinese New Year video.
Silencing critics
Of course, Zahid is only one of Umno’s many enemies within who are doing further damage to the party’s already tattered image.
Last month, a Hulu Selangor Umno Youth leader reportedly attacked Second Deputy Education Minister P Kamalanathan with a punch on the neck over a school transfer issue.
Is violence or the threat of it part of Umno’s strategy in silencing critics or those who dare complain about the depressing state of the nation?
Interestingly, the mob that killed chickens in their anger against Kok and other opposition figures were professing to protect the sanctity of Islam, a claim we have been hearing a lot lately from groups with a similar violent bent, even as they complain about unfair western portrayals of Islam as a violent religion.
And Umno, despite claiming to be a better protector of Islam than its rivals, does not seem to care that the religion ends up as collateral damage from the words and deeds of these hypocrites.

“Use your head not your arms.”
That is what the chinese believe. Smart people use their brains and rely on reasons but stupid people resort to brute force and putting fear in others.
We know that umno consisted of half-past sixes. This is a well known fact which monsterO’mamak himself confirmed not too long ago.
Can we then in all honesty expect them not to use brute force or putting fear in others?

That Zahid Hamidi don’t care is quite obvious and a lost cause. The issue is why do his supporters don’t care either? Truth is Zahid Hamidi is a fake – this is a guy who was one of Anwar Ibrahim most fierciest supporter when he was favoured by the rising Anwar – only to grovel to Anwar’s enemies when his patron fell far enough, clawing his way back with even more brutishness.
In other words, take away Hamidi’s sheer brute power and what you have is scared small Gollum character. Those who think that is leadership and strength, insult and demean themselves..The real question is why there is so many so willing?

1745,"Democratic AG frontrunner Andrew Cuomo’s campaign (finally) sent out a press release this afternoonÂ about its anti-Mark Green ad, which has been on the air in NYC since at least last night.
Cuomo spokeswoman Wendy Katz says the spot is in response to the “Mean Green attack machine.”
Katz accused Green of running “divisive and destructive campaigns” for 25 years, adding: “We will not allow his mudslinging to distort the facts of Andrew’s proven record of results.”
So, it’s Labor Day weekend, and Cuomo was comfortably ahead in the most recent Marist poll, yet he puts out an attack ad. I just don’t get it. Unless there’s something he knows that we don’t. Or maybe he’s simply paranoid.
Here’s the script:
The New York Times dubbed Mark Green “a perennial candidate”
He held a “useless post.” (The Daily News).
Accomplished little, except, in his last campaign “to divide New Yorkers against each other.” (The Amsterdam News).
So if you see Green’s ads attacking Andrew Cuomo’s service in Bill Clinton’s cabinet, know this:
Chuck Schumer and Eliot Spitzer praised Cuomo’s leadership in taking on the gun lobby.
And Bill Clinton himself said:
Cuomo “ledÂ one of the most dramatic and successful reforms of a federal agency in modern U.S. history.”
Andrew Cuomo for attorney general.Â (Still photo of Cuomo with Spitzer)
Using the paper that has endorsed Green to take a shot at him seems awfully vindictive. Or perhaps it’s simply a reaction to the fact that the endorsement had just as many negative things to say about Cuomo as it did positive things about Green.
As a commentor on a previous post noted, the whole gun lawsuitÂ thing is actually a rather sticky issue, and one that caused considerable tension in the relationship between Cuomo and Spitzer.
It’s kind of an odd one for Cuomo to choose to highlight – particularly in an ad in which he’s using Spitzer’s image.
The attorney general actually initiated talks during his first term in office aimed at getting gun makers to adopt a code of condict in hopes of changing the way they do business and staunching the flow of firearms to criminals.Â
The talks wereÂ ”taken over” by Cuomo, The New York Times reported in June 2000, much to Spitzer’s consternation. The Clinton administration had reportedly become concerned the effortsÂ initiatedÂ on the state and local levelsÂ were lagging, and wanted to step things up a notch.Â
Both Cuomo and Spitzer threatenedÂ lawsuitsÂ if companies didn’t comply – a threat on whichÂ Spitzer eventually followed through, along with some 31 other governments, including Chicago, Atlanta, Boston and Los Angeles.
The federal government considered joining their ranks, but instead negotiated a deal only with Smith & Wesson, from which the company promptly backed away, and ended up making its something of a pariah in the industry.
SpitzerÂ lost his suit, which argued the gun manufacturersÂ were contributing to a public nuisance and asked for an abatement injunction that would have required the companies to change their business practices.Â
Also over at The Daily Politics, BenÂ is suggesting David Axelrod made this ad, which is interesting, since Cuomo’s last spot was cut by Spitzer’s ad man, Jimmy Siegel.
I can’t imagine Team Spitzer giving the go-ahead to Siegel to use the gun lawsuit stuff in an attack on Green, whose brother is not only bankrolling his campaign, but has given generously to Spitzer’s gubernatorial bid, too.

This being our first Xmas in Singapore we opted to explore the buffet options in the local hotels and happened upon a splendid spread at Le Meridien, reasonably priced at $35 plus, plus.
""Plus, Plus"" is used to describe the two taxes that are added to your bill. The first being GST and the second, a tourism tax.
Today's menu included a combination of East and West with such delicacies as Goose with Chinese pears, turkey with all the trimmings and other 'weight watchers delights'. All beautifully prepared and we shall return next year for more of the same.
Post-lunch we went for a jaunt down Orchard Road as there was meant to be entertainment. Lots of Filipino maids enjoying their day off and not much else to see except a brace of ""Chinese Josephs"" and one oversized ""Herod"". I should add that to be photographed with one of the aforementioned 'Josephs' cost one a donation of $5 - for charity of course.

1043,"Elizabeth II annuls Fred Goodwin knighthood
Tuesday, January 31, 2012
Queen Elizabeth II, the British monarch, has today withdrawn and annulled a knighthood given to Fred Goodwin in 2004, heeding the advice given to her by a forfeiture committee. Goodwin is the former chief executive at the Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS) and was awarded his knighthood by the British government of the time for services to banking. The committee concluded “that widespread concerns about Fred Goodwin’s decision meant that the retention of a knighthood for services to banking could not be sustained.”
Goodwin was chief executive of RBS when they purchased ABN AMRO, a Netherlands bank, in 2007. The British government subsequently bailed out RBS for £45 billion, amidst the late-2000s financial crisis.
British prime minister David Cameron stated about the annulment: “The proper process has been followed and I think we’ve ended up with the right decision.” Cameron and Ed Miliband, UK Leader of the Opposition, both believed Goodwin’s knighthood should be removed. Miliband called it “the start of the change we need in our boardrooms.”
Liberal Democrat leader and Deputy PM Nick Clegg considered it to be the “right decision”. “[A]ppropriate” was the word George Osborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer used to describe it. “RBS came to symbolise everything that went wrong in the British economy in the last decade,” Osborne stated. Alex Salmond, First Minister of Scotland stated the title was given “for services to banking which could not therefore be sustained”, calling the decision “correct”.
Goodwin does not have the right to appeal against the decision, nor had the right to provide the forfeiture committee with any representations. The monarch holds sole responsibility for withdrawing all knighthoods; on this occasion Elizabeth II followed the advice of the committee, who decided to recommend the withdrawal to her. The Cabinet Office announced the advice had been given to the queen on the understanding that “Goodwin had brought the honours system in to disrepute”.
Speaking of the “exceptional case”, the committee explained: “In 2008, the government had to provide £20 billion of new equity to recapitalise RBS and ensure its survival and prevent the collapse of confidence in the British banking system. Subsequent increases in government capital have brought the total necessary injection of taxpayers’ money in RBS to £45.5 billion.” The committee understood that “Fred Goodwin was the dominant decision maker at RBS at the time.”
Until this announcement, criminal conviction and professional expulsion were the only causes for which individuals had their knighthoods revoked.

622,"Koch Membrane Systems, Inc. (KMS), a developer and manufacturer of innovative filtration and separation systems, will introduce the new MegaMagnum water treatment system at the AWWA Annual Conference & Exposition at the Moscone Center in San Francisco, Calif. from June 12-16, 2005. The pre-engineered, packaged system utilizes 18-in. diameter MegaMagnum membrane elements, the world’s largest spiral-wound reverse osmosis elements, to significantly reduce the cost, footprint and installation time of municipal and industrial water treatment systems.
MegaMagnum systems require half of the floor space compared to a rack with 8-in. membrane elements. A single 18 x 61 in. MegaMagnum spiral element contains 2,800 sq. ft. of membrane surface area, compared to 400 sq. ft. in commonly deployed 8 x 40 in. products. The number of elements used in a MegaMagnum system is one-seventh the number of elements needed to produce the same water quantity and quality at the same fouling rate in a standard system with 8-in. elements operating at similar fluxes and pressures. This gives an 80% reduction in the required number of connections and O-rings, thereby increasing reliability and further reducing costs.
The pre-engineered packaged systems enable fast installation and start-up. These systems are available in four configurations, with nominal flow capacity ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 million gal. per day. To facilitate shipment and installation, the systems are mounted on one or two skids, depending on the system size. KMS has also developed a special system for easy loading and unloading of the large elements.
The standard package includes flow meters, pressure transmitters, a conductivity meter, a variable frequency drive and a human machine interface with touch screen, data trending and Ethernet access. Optional equipment includes systems for antiscalant dosing, acid dosing, chlorine monitoring and cleaning-in-place (CIP)..

537,"A UKRAINIAN MILITARY official has said that Russia had given its forces an ultimatum to surrender in Crimea or face an all-out assault on the strategic Black Sea peninsula that has been overrun by Kremlin-backed troops.
However, the Russian Black Sea fleet based in Crimea denied the plans, calling reports of an ultimatum “nonsense,” Interfax said.
“That is complete nonsense,” a representative of the fleet was quoted as saying.
“We are used to daily accusations about using force against our Ukrainian colleagues,” he said.
“Clash”
“Efforts to make us clash won’t work.”
“The ultimatum is to recognise the new Crimean authorities, lay down our weapons and leave, or be ready for an assault,” regional Ukrainian defence ministry spokesman Vladyslav Seleznyov told AFP in the Crimean capital Simferopol.
“It may be at 1:00 am, 2:00 am, 3:00 am (Tuesday). There are different times,” he said.
Ukraine has accused Russia of pouring more troops into Crimea as world leaders grappled with Europe’s worst standoff since the Cold War.

713,"Astor-Bannerman create an accessible Changing Places as part of a large scale regeneration project at the historic Guildhall at Brangwyn Hall in Swansea
The Guildhall has undergone a huge amount of regeneration work to sympathetically modernize this stunning multipurpose entertainment venue whilst keeping and restoring many of the original features.
Incorporating accessible features has been incredibly important for this project and the venue boasts a number of wheelchair friendly entrances and exits which are all clearly marked.
There is also the added benefit of a dropped bar area for wheelchair users to order their interval drinks as well as a fantastic Changing Places facility.
Astor-Bannerman were called upon to help the Guildhall with their Changing Places project and guide them through each stage.
An initial site visit took place by our Product Specialist Advisor which was followed up with CAD drawings of the room layout and a quotation for the required equipment.
All of these services were provided free of charge and meant that the installation which took place in the Spring 2014 went ahead smoothly.
Once the preliminary work and electrics were in place, a qualified Astor-Bannerman engineer visited the site to ensure everything was correct and ready for installation in accordance with our pre installation requirements.
The specialist equipment chosen for the Guildhall Changing Places toilet included the Astor-Bannerman bariatric Changing Table CT190 and the A2B Overhead XY Ceiling hoist.
The CT190 Changing Table is fully height adjustable at the touch of a handset and folds away neatly against the wall when not in use.
The stretcher is made of a special high tension tear resistant material with drain holes and integrated water tray for ease of showering. A tilting backrest and removable mattress were also chosen for additional comfort during changing.
The Astor-Bannerman A2B 2 Function Ceiling Hoist was chosen for the Changing Places facility for its full room coverage and ease of use from the simple handset control.
The hoist allow users to be transferred from toilet to Changing Table or wheelchair with ease and dignity.

1020,"Interview with Subject Of Thoughts!
- Details
- Category: Interviews
Thanks for this interview for PerfectProg.Com ----Mark Baston (interviewer)
1. When did Subject To Thoughts come to be?
Well, it's funny how this project came alive. Back in 1999, when I got my first keyboard, it really started out as a joke. I thought, I'll write a couple of songs and that'll be the end of that, but then things started to take a turn. I first started calling the project Symphony of Thoughts, but I decided to change it to Subject to Thoughts. The first songs I wrote were utter crap, but I was starting to develop a style. It was not until I did “The Thought Process” cassette demo (back in 2003) when I realized that this was starting to get more serious. Eventually, it has.
It was not until late 2006 or early 2007 (2 cassette demos & 2 CD's already completed) that I realized that I needed to add a vocalist because I was getting no where with my singing, so I added Brandon Strader to the mix. How me and Brandon started working together is funny. I sent my CD “From Emptiness to Beyond” for a review at Ultimate Metal, fortunately, Brandon was the reviewer. I guess he liked the music that much thus gave it a favorable review. We've been friends ever since.
2. The style seems quite moody, Who are your influences musically?
My influences are Dream Theater, My Dying Bride, Katatonia, Anekdoten & Enchant. Two other bands that have been a big influence are Type O Negative. R.I.P. Pete Steele & Vanden Plas. Even though we sound nothing like these bands, I guess that's where the mix of moody & Progressive sound comes from.
3. What do you think of today's mainstream music?
Crap. Don't listen too it & don't care for it.
4. What sort of audience are you trying to connect with, be it Prog, Ambient, Doom or other?
Well, I really don't have a specific fan base I'm trying to reach, but I guess since our music is in the Progressive genre, that's probably the people who will probably take more of an interest in our stuff. However, I'm content with any listener who wishes to listen and appreciate what we're trying to accomplish. Of course, our music is not for everybody.
5. You have 2 projects, the other being ""Transcend with Time"" Is it hard to do both of them simultaneously?
Well, for me not really. I guess that's where my passion for music takes over. Of course, sometimes it can get a little hectic writing music for 2 different genres, but that's why I pace myself and I usually work on finishing one album then start working on the next. Since I tend to release an album every year for Transcend with Time which is my New Age/Ambient project, I usually start by first getting into my “New Age” mode. Then I start writing the music around Spring & into Fall. But I always go in knowing the direction I want the album to take, so that makes my work much easier.
For Subject to Thoughts which is my/our Progressive Rock/Metal project, it's a little different because I have to write both the music & lyrics; however, that'll probably change for future releases. Well, musically only. I guess getting into my “Prog/Doom” mode is much easier because that's the type of music I listen to everyday; however, before anything I go in with a plan as to which direction I want the lyrics to go in & music. Since we don't release an album every year that makes my job easier; however, when this project was still a solo one, I used to release an album every year. Brandon however told me to slow down, so I'll try. Usually how like doing this is I first write the lyrics then the music. For me, writing lyrics is the easy part. I guess because I've been writing lyrics since I was about 12.
So, it sounds like a lot of going back and forth with both projects. Sometimes it is, but that's the price of being a musician with multiple projects. In the end, I'm content because both projects give me the different levels of gratification.
6. The Culmination was just released on May 5, 2010, what's the album about?
Well, “The Culmination” is the final part to the 4 part conceptual vision I started with “From Emptiness to Beyond” back in 2005. “The Culmination” is about finding closure to life. Lyrically, this album dealt with a lot of personal stuff, but all the albums I've written, are about real-life. Musically, it's Dark, Progressive & Melodic.
7. What would you like Subject to Thoughts to be remembered as?
Well, even though it's already been 11 years since I started this project, I hardly think we'll be remembered. Geez, most people don't even know we exist. But that's okay, all that matters to me anyway is that I have (in some way) fulfilled my dream of becoming a musician and along the way made some good music. But to answer your question, I would like Subject to Thoughts to be remembered as a Progressive Rock/Metal band that always strived to play original, thought-provoking music and thus creating our own unique sound. But we are not going anywhere just yet, we're going to continue to make the music we love for as long as we can. I can honestly say that probably the best is yet to come (hopefully).
You can check their website at Updated (Monday, 18 October 2010)",How did the band Subject to Thoughts add a vocalist to their lineup?,"The band added a vocalist when the band's creator sent his CD “From Emptiness to Beyond” for a review at Ultimate Metal. The reviewer, Brandon Strader, liked the music so much that he gave it a favorable review. After this, they started working together and Brandon became the vocalist for Subject to Thoughts."
498," doctor by training, she became national public health minister only to get booted from the Sadat administration and sent to prison for her antifundamentalist politics. In unabashedly didactic fiction and nonfiction that she began writing in her twenties, Saadawi applied her clinical impulse to eviscerating supposedly sacred systems of belief, ritual, economics, and psychology. Female genital mutilation is now sensationalistic fodder for CNN, but it was Saadawi who first held up a bloody fist in the 1970s and-speaking from her own childhood experience-called for the practice's end. Saadawi held her people accountable for how deeply sexual hypocrisies penetrate the national culture, outraging Egypt with matter-of-fact treatises on abortion, illegitimacy, female sexuality, wife-beating and humiliation, arranged marriages of girls to men, the complicity of women in perpetuating the misery of other women in order to reap the crumbs of men's power. In thanks she got her books banned, and in 1992 had to flee to escape fundamentalist death threats.
It's hard to say more about Saadawi's career without hitting the library-her somber autobiography, A Daughter of Isis, ends before she's even out of medical school. That's perhaps a sign of good judgment. The same fierce sense of self and righteousness that have served her so well in her remarkable life are in plentiful supply here, better suited in their heroic sweep to fantastically outsized childhood memories than they would be to honest reflection on her career. It takes a little while to get cozy with this precocious girl, who lets it be known that at the age of nine or so, ""walking down the street was enough for me to hate all males, all boys and all men."" Her unfashionably direct rage is certainly fathomable as she chronicles her young life as a nonperson, destined by birth to serve at the command of father, husband, and a constellation of aunts who have been delegated by custom and their own unhappiness to groom her for a life of servitude.
Her mostly comfortable girldom in a Nile Valley village is punctuated by bouts of pain and humiliation. Dumped in a basin of water by a disgusted midwife. Pierced through the ears with a hot needle. Clitoridectomized, forcibly body-waxed, groped, paraded in front of suitors who ""one by one ... discovered that I loved the touch of the pen in my hand much more than the feel of the ladle or the handle of a broom, and so one by one they disappeared like the whiff of a gentle breeze in the night."" With a doctor's compulsion to comprehend bodies, Saadawi lets her experiences flow through them-how her many aunts feel and smell, how her nipple aches when one of them pinches it (""like the sting of a scorpion, or the bite of a snake""-the pinch is supposed to bring good fortune in finding a husband), her experience of her first period, in which she was so desperate to get Allah's forgiveness that she bled all over, and thus desecrated a prayer rug.
Saadawi wants to retrieve the female body, starting with her own, from the pit of shame into which her culture has cast it. Writing these memoirs while teaching at Duke, Saadawi persists, somewhat awkwardly, in trying to give her international feminist readers what she's heard them clamor for: a seamless account of oppression, in which women suffer demonstrable wrongs. But with the chance to write her own life, she also takes the opportunity to render her own experiences, which until now she has told in unshaded black-and-white, in full and complex color. Just six pages in Saadawi begins to recount her genital cutting, only to hesitate and say that she has not yet been able to bring herself to write fully about it. That isn't precisely true. She launches the first section of The Hidden Face of Eve, her unrelenting 1977 exposé of the place of women in Arab culture, with a memory of the experience as vivid as any six-year-old's could be expected to be. What's more, her account has her mother chatting and laughing with Nawal's aunts as she bleeds-a collaborator, not the well of inspiration to whom A Daughter of Isis is essentially dedicated.
Reimagined in autobiography, Saadawi wields her self-mythology as something more than a political tool. If anything, she overcompensates in the opposite direction, adopting a dreamy, impressionistic voice that initially reads more like an unremarkable piece of personal anthropology than the life of someone who'd grow up to change her world. But though it takes too long to get there, once she moves from confusing atmosphere-setting to actually trying to figure out how a girl in her circumstances became an outlaw subversive, A Daughter of Isis becomes a striking study of the female ego in impossible circumstances. It ends up more consistent with the spirit of explanatory American feminists-Betty Friedan, Carol Gilligan, Surviving Ophelia-than with Saadawi's own polemics.

1591,"When we were finally able to go back to school and resume semi-normal instruction, I had convinced myself that getting back into the groove of grinding for exams and having an impeccable work ethic would be muscle memory. However, I was mistaken and was quickly met with premature burnout and overwhelming stress. I had not realized how comfortable and routine online classes and exams were, so I was completely unprepared for in-person midterm season. And after experiencing it in its entirety, I now know that it’s important to avoid having unrealistic expectations for myself when adjusting to in-person exams.
I had not realized how much I missed the vibe of midterms season on campus. All students have a shared feeling of distress, and it’s hard to feel alone in that sense. Seeing everyone studying late with empty coffee cups or Yerba Mate cans littering the table gave me a sense of satisfaction knowing that things were going back to normal. But I was completely blindsided by how daunting midterms season actually was.
After two years of being disconnected from our professors and peers, many who were able to have in-person classes were thrown back into a normal lecture hall setting without any preparation but the summer before. Instead of phoning it in and logging onto a Zoom call five minutes before the start time, and having the luxury of most exams being open book, myself and many other UCR students had to fall back into the old routine of difficult, closed note exams.
All three of my classes for fall quarter were in-person, which meant that I had all of my midterm exams on campus. I underestimated how much time I needed to study for each exam and felt less confident after them compared to previous years. Being in lockdown completely killed my attention span, so it was hard for me to sit still and focus in a class for 1 hour and 20 minutes 一 let alone take an exam. I was so used to having exams with no time limit and being able to get up and do something else during a Zoom lecture that I forgot to manage my time, and as a result, I overworked myself to the point of premature burnout.
My biggest takeaway from this experience is to definitely learn how to space out study sessions and give myself more breaks. I also learned that I should not be so hard on myself when it comes to in-person midterm seasons. Many students probably share this same experience, so it’s important to remind everyone that mental health and rest is what matters the most. Going back to in-person instruction is an adjustment that takes time for everyone, and it’ll take some time until everyone is comfortable again.

Good show
Fine outlet to showcase talents from the independent wrestling scene. Audio quality is okay. Banter among the hosts is entertaining, though rambling at times. This revamped version is a ""step up"" from past episodes.
Great job guys!
Scott & Matt do a tremendous job talking to both the veteran and younger talent that they cross paths with in their travels in Independent wrestling. A very laid back show with just two friends hanging out and discussing what they love. It's very hard to not have a good, postive vibe towards wrestling once they wrap up each show.
Excellent
A weekly take on wrestling from the Indy scene in North Carolina spotlighting the AIWF, which is bringing back territorial wrestling? Count me in. Scott and Matt have a good thing going here, definitely listen in. The possibilities are endless.

1925,"Alternate To Typical Artificial Supplements Is Required, Say Experts
Whole food supplements is presently a subject of around the world rate of interest. A wealth of proof has just recently come to light recommending that average artificial multivitamin supplements might be harmful to your health and wellness. Goran Bjelakovic, a reputable scientist from the College of Copenhagen, headed up a substantial meta-study that took a look at the outcomes of 67 placebo-controlled trials formerly undertaken to identify the effects of vitamin and also anti-oxidant supplements on long life. In the end, the research study integrated monitorings of 232 000 test subjects. By utilizing such a large populace sample, a research study can come to be far more effective when it come to identifying large trends as well as getting over human prejudice.
The results of the evaluation, released in the Journal of the American Medical Organization, were absolutely nothing less than surprising. Looking at people with diabetic issues, cardiovascular disease and also lung cancer, in addition to healthy and balanced, normal individuals, there was no noticeable benefit to taking popular fractionated supplements like Vitamin A, Vitamin E, Vitamin C, Selenium, or beta-Carotene. As a matter of fact, the outcomes entered the opposite direction – there was an enhanced opportunity of death (16 percent) amongst Vitamin An individuals, a 7 percent higher death price among beta-Carotene users, and also a 4 percent mortality boost in Vitamin E individuals. Beta-Carotene as well as Retinol, advertised as anti-carcinogenic agents, may promote lung cancer. That’s right – pills marketed as helping you towards a much longer, healthier life remain in fact correlated with a speedier demise. This research made use of regular supplements on the market made from artificial vitamins.
To add fuel to the fire, a recent research released in the British Journal of Nutrition under the uninspired title of “Ascorbic Acid Supplements Does Not Attenuate Post-Exercise Muscle Soreness Complying With Muscle-Damaging Exercise However May Delay The Recovery Refine” showed that supplementation with anti-oxidants from synthetic resources may turn around a lot of the valuable results of physical training.
Currently, this is not to say that anti-oxidants or vitamins are bad for you. Vice versa – these supplements were produced on the basis of strong scientific research. Anti-oxidants are still believed to protect cells from the ravages of totally free radicals. The problem, rather, is the concept that you can get those benefits from synthetic isolated compounds. Condition and the aging process are typically far more difficult than test-tube research studies can account for. In addition, the issue of bioavailability is an ever-present concern. Lots of typical artificial supplements consist of significant quantities of the marketed vitamin, yet do not have the extra compounds needed to make certain that their essential ingredients are in fact absorbed by the body. Passing right through the digestion tract, these ‘wonder health cures’ usually wind up doing little past providing people costly urine. To the rescue … Whole Food Supplements.
What the layman should take from all this is not a sense that we have actually made no progression in the last century pertaining to revealing sufficient means of personal health maintenance. There’s one point that no one is disputing, which’s the significance of a healthy, well-shaped diet regimen abundant in fruit, orange, yellow as well as dark eco-friendly leafy veggies, entire grains, legumes, seeds, nuts, excellent quality carbohydrates and also lean proteins and supplements from entire food supplements. When you avoid absorbing harmful chemicals such as those in food chemicals, flavors, taste boosters and also ‘synthetic vitamin ingredients’, you’ll not only decrease your consumption of toxic substances. You’ll additionally be forced to tap into one of the most nutritionally reputable resource available, namely all-natural nutrition. Humans have progressed to consume unprocessed plant and pet food sources. Current research suggests that the superiority of all-natural proportions and also solutions has actually been greatly underestimated.

Teme Triangle readers singled out Jan ‘The Milk’ Young for special praise during the snow and freezing temperatures that brought most of the Teme valley to a standstill in March.
Most of Jan’s regular customers were amazed and delighted to get their milk and newspapers delivered to their door every day of the severe weather except one when blizzard conditions effectively closed most roads in the area. Jan and her milk round partner Phil Gray managed their daily 60 mile round trip on every other day, including Sunday.
“We’ve only missed two days in 30 years,” says Jan proudly. She maintains her round seven days a week to over 800 houses in the Broadheath, Clifton and Shelsleys area as well as many schools, always keeping an eye on the elderly and the vulnerable in all weather.
Growing concern about plastic pollution has brought an unexpected bonus to Jan in the form of several new customers who prefer to buy their milk in glass bottles instead of plastic containers.

Fasting & Abstinence Guidelines
Fasting and abstinence are done to honor the suffering and death of Christ and to prepare ourselves to celebrate his resurrection.
Fasting refers to the amount of food consumed as well as the times food is eaten. Abstinence means the avoidance of certain types of food.
These guidelines are from the United States Council of Catholic Bishops:
Ash Wednesday and Good Friday are obligatory days of fasting and abstinence.
Fridays during Lent are obligatory days of abstinence for those age 14 and up. Church law specifies abstaining from eating meat, such as poultry, beef, lamb or pork, as an act of penitence.
Fasting is obligatory from age 18 until age 59. When fasting, a person is permitted to eat one full meal, as well as two smaller meals that together are not equal to a full meal.
In all cases, common sense should prevail, and people who are ill should not further jeopardize their health by fasting. Those that are excused from fast and abstinence (outside the age limits) include the physically or mentally ill, individuals suffering from a chronic illness, and pregnant or nursing women.",What are the guidelines for fasting and abstinence according to the United States Council of Catholic Bishops?,"Ash Wednesday and Good Friday are obligatory days of fasting and abstinence.

1593,"Grieving mum faces £10,000 fine following balloon release in memory of father-in-law who died of covid
A mum from Peterlee says she is refusing to pay a £10,000 fine for a balloon release following the death of her father-in-law which she “thought was right at the time” to uplift grieving family members.
Vicki Hutchinson, 34, is due to appear in court charged with a £10,000 fine for breaching lockdown regulations after a balloon release was held following the death of her father-in-law.
The mum-of-three says she feels the fine is “unfair” in comparison to other covid breaches across the UK, adding that she isn’t a “celebrity who can pay this sort of money.”
Vicki’s father in law Ian Stephenson, 58, sadly died of coronavirus four days before his birthday in November last year and a balloon release event was organised by Ms Hutchinson for initially just family members.
The 34-year-old received a legal letter earlier this week accusing her of holding a gathering of more than 30 people in a tier four area on November 14 and explained she has been charged to appear at Peterlee Magistrates' Court next month.
The business owner says she refuses to pay the fine as the family already “lost everything” when her father-in-law passed away.
She said: “I’m a normal person who works to look after my family – I’m not paying anything because it’s not fair.
""I wanted to hold the balloon release to make family members happy after Ian died, I did what I thought was right at the time and we can’t be hurt anymore than we already have been.”
The cafe and sunbed salon owner says she consciously bought bio-degradable balloons and cleared the area following the release as she has always tried to be environmentally friendly after working in a recycling centre in the past.
She added: “Everyone was socially distant in the open air and most were wearing masks, I did everything to make sure everyone was safe – We of all people know how covid can take somebody’s life so quickly.”
Ms Hutchinson insists that the family don’t want any fundraising pages set up in aid of the fine.
She said: “Ian was a very well liked man in the community, he was one of kind and I couldn’t help people turning up – We were all grieving so I will not pay this fine.”","Why is Vicki Hutchinson, a mum from Peterlee, facing a £10,000 fine?","Vicki Hutchinson is facing a £10,000 fine for breaching lockdown regulations after a balloon release was held following the death of her father-in-law.

Edited by Stephanie Chambers, Jane Farrow, Maureen FitzGerald, Ed Jackson, John Lorinc, Tim McCaskell, Rebecka Sheffield, Tatum Taylor and Rahim Thawer
Coach House Books
280 pp; $25.95
Ziggy Stardust is everywhere in the early 1970s, but dressing in drag is still illegal. And yet remnants of the trade are always in evidence. Muddy lipstick, smudged mascara, hollow cheekbones made even more hollow with small pots of creamy rose blush they share for economy.
They – a band of sexual outcasts – roll in from the Parkside and St. Charles taverns, no farther than three blocks from Fran’s at College and Yonge, and take up residence, occupying the carrot-orange leatherette booths in my section from midnight until dawn. The diner is their twenty-four-hour beacon, its garish fluorescence highlighting display-case pies and triple layer cakes, the puddings, and toppling bowls of colourful, whipped-cream Jell-O. The taunting aroma of fresh eggs, bacon, and hickory-smoked ham teases its way through wafts of freshly brewed coffee.
I am nineteen and new to the city, a Port Credit exile who has run from my mother’s sad and intransigent life in the Lakeshore Psychiatric Hospital. They show me a Polaroid snapshot of themselves. In it, all but one are thin and decked out in boas, fishnet stockings, and the shiny material my mother once loved. Makeshift costumes, provocative and sheer. They lean at longlegged angles in metal chairs and against high-back stools, earnest, fierce, dignified, their painted lips slightly parted. Their wigs remind me of movie stars – Gina Lollobrigida, Candice Bergen, Brigitte Bardot – and they are thrilled when I tell them so. Only one pair of eyes stares back into the camera, her gaze penetrating and sad, a jumble of questions and answers.
They like me, not only because I take care of their immediate needs and don’t complain, but perhaps because they see me as one of their tribe, an outsider living in a rooming house, adrift in a city rife with rejection. They call me ‘Girl’ and, looking past my tired orange-beige uniform and pantyhose, compliment me on my style. My pale face and coal-black hair prompt cries of ‘Morticia’ and ‘Sally Bowles.’
Weaving my way through the cigarette smoke, I worry about how I will pay my rent working the graveyard shift. Tips on toasted Danish and coffee are paltry, and refills are free. In any event, these after-hours diners don’t have much money.
But the girls offer me every other manner of sustenance, their advice wide-ranging and firm. How to stand upright in platform boots. Must-see movies (Blonde Cobra, Flaming Creatures, Funeral Parade of Roses, Something for Everyone, and The Boys in the Band, a sentimental favourite). The simplest and safest technique for unrolling a condom. The tidiest way to hand-roll a cigarette. How to turn on a lover. When to move on.
They tell me about their role model, their matriarch, Michelle DuBarry. In
their voices I hear a protective savagery. I listen to their stories of laneways and parks, the places where they go looking for men, not merely for sex but also for connection. The hot spots where they gather. Spadina Avenue, the Quest, the Manatee, Cherry Beach. They talk about chat, which I later discover is the Community Homophile Association of Toronto. I remember the acronym because I like to talk.
They share other stories, too – stories that cast shadows. I hear about Christmases and Thanksgivings, and sons who, if they are invited home at all, are advised to behave. They tell me about missed funerals of fathers and brothers and beloved grandmothers. About cruel lovers, and loving johns who hold them until dawn.
One night, a willowy young man named Jimmy comes in looking haunted. He has been battered in Queen’s Park. Two cops, he says, thrashed the shit out of him, but you can’t see the marks on account of the hoses. And then he laughs, and doesn’t stop laughing until everyone joins him, his eyes a milky blue, the tears barely visible as they cluster and slide down his face.
Every shift, I watch police on the beat stroll up to the cash to collect free cups of coffee and pastry, a guarantee of protection for the all-night restaurant. Here, the officers pay no mind to my section, either oblivious or intentional, much in the way most customers are blind to the occasional cockroach that scurries up the wall out by the kitchen.
During holiday season, and sometimes for no reason at all, I am bestowed with trinkets and treats – dangly earrings from a Yonge Street kiosk, a carton of Kent cigarettes, a packet of matches, its cover painted with dancing hula girls.
Once, on my birthday, they bought me a heavenly piece of Fran’s mile-high lemon meringue pie. And when they sing ‘Happy Birthday,’ they harmonize, their voices melodic and tender, their serenade followed by hugging and kissing.
I haven’t felt this loved since I last saw my mother.
Many memories endure from those long-ago night shifts. Hands clasped over mouths, aghast or in playful hysteria. Heads huddled together in conspiratorial whisper. Sugar dispensers turned upside down over half-empty coffee cups, contents pouring out at length for comic effect. Voices raised in debate, sometimes in anger or resignation, and always a coming together.
And I wonder – what became of them? Did they stay in the city? Who found love? After I had moved on, did they like the new waitress as much as they had liked me? Do they miss the old days? Who survived? Do they remember me in the way that I remember them?
The very last shift I worked at Fran’s was a cold one, the snow blowing and bereft. I had switched for an earlier time slot, a farewell drink waiting for me at the Demimonde Colonial Tavern, a new life in the offing in Fredericton, New Brunswick. I felt compelled to find relatives who barely knew me, longing to shake off a tumbleweed future. My shift ended well before midnight. As I walked out into the darkness, I heard their siren song call out from the restaurant radio.

Yesterday I sautéed the local swiss chard with yellow peppers and onions, make some spicy lentils, steamed kale, made a meatloaf and a yummy thick green smoothie. When I am in the kitchen with the radio on, things start to make sense. What are your grounding practices?
Here are 4 ways to keep your head above water while you go through life's ups and downs...
- Eliminate the word ""should"". I stop imposing thoughts of what I ""should"" or ""could"" be doing. Keep focusing on your purpose...your main vision and goals. For me, the #1 goal is to keep Kennedy in happy, healthy spirits so that she can fight to recover. I don't think of the programs I ""should"" be applying to, the job I ""could have"" kept.
- Stay positive. But how can I when THIS is going on? Not to sound cliché, but we can always find a silver lining. I have been talking about this with Kennedy. At least she will be out of school for 10 weeks. Score. At least I am off work and able to be with her. Score. More time for art. Score. See? Silver lining.
- Use less energy. Don't overwhelm yourself with to-do list as long as a Shakespearian monologue. Just keep it simple and put a few random things that will make you feel successful. Leo says Kill Your To Do List, but I simply can't do that! It's the one thing that keeps me organized and feeling like I am able to do something in a situation where I otherwise have NO control. Spend time in bed. Not crying, just being...reading/watching funny movies. Take bubble baths. Drink tea. Wear fuzzy socks.
- Remind yourself that ""This too shall pass"" and trust me, it will. It is simple science. The clock will keep ticking and whatever you are going through will come to pass. You will be stronger because of it. And those around you (in my case my daughter) will see the test of your character by how you responded through the crisis/chaos.
It is easy when you are walking through the fires of life to think you've fallen off the wagon. Well, we are able to breathe through the deep waters.
How does one stay healthy?
- Think about how to do the MOST important healthy things. For me that includes veggies and water
- Green smoothie daily
- 2-3 L water daily
- Salad every other day minimum
- Those simple 3 things guide my meals/menus
- I buy Gluten Free wraps and small packs of organic hummus. I then can load the wraps with tons of lettuce or veggies and BAM a healthy quick meal.
- I tend to overeat any bars that I buy so now I shy away from purchasing any; however, I will make power balls (dates, any nut, rolled in coconut give or take an ingredient or two) and keep em in a container for energy and hunger strikes.
- Once home from the hospital I'll be making a huge pot of soup for the week (the weather is conducive to it now)

your trying to say an attack that worked on a peak human would work on yusuke is the dumbest thing ive ever heard ""Strawman.
and \you havent proven that yusuke's demon aura wouldnt simply meltYusuke's Yoki would certainly melt away when faced with Roshi's aura.
you havent proven roshi could tank a punch for yusuke let alone a sprit gunAt best ANY attack Yusuke can produce is the same level as what Roshi dishes out BY ACCIDENT (e.i Guymao's castly incident)

havent proven roshi would even hurt yusukeNo offence to you, but this is a retarded statement.
show roshi reading someones mind in a fight? if he could he wouldnt get hit some much dont you thinkHe has read Namu's mind, and Tsuru Senin's.

""The explanation is simple, if she can destroy a planet with a punch, that just means she was holding back when she headbuted Blue, because she didn't want to kill him, only bfr him, unlike Tao who wanted to kill him.
can you believe that? i haven seen a lot of posts about this ""
How does one believe someone with less training and martial arts experience can beat the other? Master Roshi has ascended way beyond normal human level and if yusuke were to go up against him in prime or old age it would be a loss. The difference would be in his prime roshi would curb stomp yusuke so fast he would give up YHS and train under the turtle house. In a fight where you cant go h2h against the opponent you must fight with energy blasts and such but thing is Roshi has the upper hand there too. In that case you would have to try for you speed as a last bet but as mentioned roshi is capable of catching machine gun fire effortlessly. Based on feats it is an overall stomp for Roshi. But i do believe he would put up a good fight.
Equalize speed and give Roshi prep for a fully charged, fully powered Kamehameha that can pulverize the moon and he takes this with one blast. Remove any one of those advantages and any Yusuke from chapter Black or beyond outright roflstomps him effortlessly.

1618,"Hello lovelies
It’s only Tuesday however it is feeling like it should be Friday. It’s rainy and muggy in Brisbane, so it really has been a yucky week, and on top of that I am transitioning off my bad anti-depressants and the drop this week is not making me feel great. Generally just feeling a bit down and out but hoping that it will get better soon.
I therefore thought I would make today’s post about songs that make me happy. This doesn’t generally mean that they are ‘happy’ songs. They are just songs that I like to listen to that perk me up a bit, where I feel like “yeah, this song knows how I feel”. SO here goes…
1. Fluorescent Adolescent – Arctic Monkeys
No idea why I love this song so much. I love listening to this song on repeat, maybe it’s the tune or just the overall meaning of the song. But for some reason I absolutely LOVE this song, and it always cheers me up when I listen to it.
2. Jellylegs – Children Collide
Holy crap this song gives me all the feels. I love this song soooo much, and I love the words. “Stretched out like a rubber band, from one planet to the next”.
3. Break the Ice – Brittney Spears
This is a bit of weird choice, as most people would probably choose Toxic or Hit me baby one more time. I came across this song one day by accident and it has remained one of my favourites ever since.
4. Everlong – Foo Fighters
Seriously, don’t even get me started on the Fooies. I have always had the BIGGEST crush on Dave Grohl. He is a God, and he is such a lovely person to add to that. I have dreams where I meet him, and then I wake up and realise it was a dream and feel really sad. I would love to meet him one day, but I honestly think I would just stand there and cry. Everlong is one of my all-time favourites and makes me so happy when I listen to it.
5. Standing outside the fire – Garth Brooks
Yes I am very versatile with my music taste, which of course includes one of country musics greats. When this song comes on I get really excited, I love the music but I also love the meaning to the song…seriously, it’s a great song.
6. Doll Parts – Hole
Ahhhh this song!!! Words can’t even express what this song does to me. I love it so much and can relate to it so much it’s not even funny. I have always loved Courtney Love, she is a rock Goddess…even though alot of people have very the very opposite opinion to me.
7. Hold on – Wilson Phillips
Umm who doesn’t love this song? It’s a classic! And it’s so corny it’s good, I love bopping along to this song.
8. I have nothing – Whitney Houston
This song puts me in power ballad mode, I love it so much. And I know all the words now (I listened to it a thousand times) and I can fully commit. This song makes me happy because it is powerful and Whitney’s voice is flawless.
9. 9 to 5 – Dolly Parton
Another song I listened to on repeat so I can fully commit to singing it. This song is great and it’s so true when you actually work a 9-5 job. Love, love, love!!!
10. Stop – Spice Girls
I love this song because of the actions. I remember watching the Spice Girls concert on tv and replaying this song and dance in the lounge room. I always played Posh Spice – because I had a black dress.
11. The Climb – Miley Cyrus
Never diss Miley with me around, because I will destroy you. I don’t really mean that, but seriously I love her soooooooo much and will argue until death that she is an amazing person and has an amazing voice and has amazing songs. I love this song so much, and in the Hannah Montana movie…aaaah 🙂
*************************************************************************
Anyways, I hope you enjoyed my little list of songs that make me happy. Have a good day!

949,"I first encountered the idea of frame of reference while an undergrad studying Physics. To the man walking down the aisle of the airplane, he’s walking a few miles per hour. From the frame of reference of someone on the ground, he’s walking several hundred miles per hour. Frame of reference refers to the myriad ways we can see the same activity. In Hatha Yoga, there are relatively few positions, though each position may relate to gravity in many different ways. Sometimes the best way to learn a given posture is to study that form in a different context.
When I first began my studies of Yoga, I was taught to lift the chest and pull the shoulders back when standing in Mountain Pose. In observing the epidemic of poor posture, this was a logical instruction. What was interesting to note, however, was how rarely this instruction led to any degree of comfort in the body. Yes, it momentarily corrected poor posture, though the benefits were often short-lived and the practitioner usually looked ill-at-ease. In many ways, the poor posture seemed more authentic, as there was less of a contrived quality.
Virtually all of us have caught sight of our reflection in a mirror or window and were shocked to see how pitched forward our head and shoulders were. Our motivation to correct this imbalanced state is well-founded, though changing the frame of reference usually yields the best results. I’ve found learning how to stand best happens on the floor. As a result, I’ve come to teach Prone Mountain far more often than I teach Mountain Pose (Tadasana).
Prone Mountain begins, as the name implies, on the belly. Start with your hands flat on the floor with your wrists beside the lower ribs. Many people find their head falling into the floor, while their chest is off the floor – this is the head-forward posture revealing itself. To build better posture, bring your chest as close as possible to the floor (flesh of the chest firm against the floor) while simultaneously lifting your nose and chin slightly off the floor. To fully realize the benefits for the spine, extend out through the crown of the head, while at the same time, stretching back through the outstretched toes. By practicing Prone Mountain in this way, you gently remind the body of its optimal spinal alignment, while building the core postural strength to help maintain good posture.
The next step is to find ease and comfort in the shoulders. The shoulders mirror the state of the lungs. If the shoulders are rounded forward, the lungs are often too cool. If the shoulders are pulled back too much, the lungs are often overheated. One is not preferable to the other – they’re both imbalances. As with most natural systems, there is a middle way that best serves the system. Prone Mountain pose helps us find the middle way of optimal health.
Return to Prone Mountain and find the optimal spinal alignment we explored earlier, and bring your attention to the shoulders. Very often at the very mention of shoulders, people reflexively pull them back to the spine. Yes, the chest is more open, but at what cost to the back lungs? Remember: the torso is three-dimensional. Opening the chest by compressing the back is a zero net gain. The optimal posture opens both front lungs and back lungs at the same time.
To do this, simply think of broadening across the place where the arm inserts into the shoulder socket. (It can be useful to have someone press on the posterior deltoid to provide feedback.) You know you’re on the right track when both upper back and chest feel broad and spacious, and you can feel the rhythmic movement of breathing in both your front and back. Don’t worry about keeping the elbows drawn in tight to your torso – in the big picture, it’s not the most important element.
When you practice Prone Mountain, the first step is to find the optimal spinal alignment. Once you’ve found this optimal alignment and created extension in the spine, find the optimal shoulder alignment such that both front and back lungs are involved with the breathing. Let this feeling seep into your body-mind for one-five minutes. You’ll likely feel the benefits of Prone Mountain once you come up on your feet into Tadasana. Your body will remember optimal alignment once it’s had the taste.
This is the first installment of Prone Mountain and Optimal Posture. Next time we’ll cover the relationship of the spine to the fore/aft body, and how the Spine Bag helps resolve long-standing postural imbalances. In the process, we’ll also expand on the frame-of-reference imagery.
Until then, Happy Holidays from all of us at Alignment Yoga!

Great entry Scott. Just this morning I sent an email to a friend in NYC detailing prone mountain...guess I should have checked the blog first! I will pass this along.
Scott, the instruction here is amazing, but I am wondering if you would include a few pictures to help us beginners visualize what you are speaking of?
It can be hard to visualize all this without images, can't it? I'll be filming a video blog entry later this month that corresponds to this essay - it'll provide step-by-step instructions. Thanks for reading!

To get the old behavior, use ""All => ''"" named parameter. * Telnet.pm (put): New method put() is like print(), except that it doesn't write the trailing output_record_separator (""\n"").

1284,"Proper cleansing: The fastest route to better skin
If you wear make-up, cleansing twice is essential and oil-based products are a good start
By far the least sexy and most neglected step in the average skincare routine, cleansing is also the step which makes the most visible difference.
If there were a key to good skin, and in reality there are several, it would be cleansing. By far the least sexy and most neglected step in the average skincare routine, it is also the step which, when performed correctly, will make the most visible difference to your skin texture and quality.
When you go to remove your makeup, cleansing twice is essential. If you’re not a wearer of makeup, cleansing once is sufficient. I don’t faff about with dedicated eye makeup removers – nothing breaks down makeup anywhere on the face like oil, so and I’ll opt for an oil cleanser like Superfacialist Vitamin C + Skin Renew Cleansing Oil (€14.99), which smells a touch like orange calpol (I rather enjoy that) but is the best cleansing oil in its price range.
A cheaper oil or balm cleanser is ideal for the first cleanse; follow that up with something more luxuriant like Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Botanical Cleansing Oil (€35), or the best product within your budget, for the second. This saves money and feels less like washing actual money down the plughole – you’ll breeze through an expensive cleanser relatively quickly using it twice daily. Though a muslin or a flannel will remove your makeup nicely, I prefer an old-fashioned flannel. I’ll buy cotton ones relatively cheaply and subject them to a screaming hot wash after each use.
Though everyone’s skin has different needs, oil is the best makeup remover for most people. It soothes dry skin and discourages oily skin from overproducing sebum. If you’re prone to congestion or breakouts, avoid essential oils and your skin will benefit from a cleansing oil.
For morning, a cleansing cream or wash will do. I like Clinique 2-in-1 Cleansing Micellar Gel + Light Makeup Remover (€23) for its gentle effectiveness, or the pleasant and entirely inoffensive Bulldog Sensitive Face Wash (€7.39) for men or cleansing-averse teenage boys. If skin feels ‘squeaky clean’ post-cleanse, chuck your cleanser into the bin with unbridled abandon – this sensation indicates it has been stripped, and flaking, greasiness, or both are imminent. After a cleanse, skin should always feel clean, soft and comfortable – never tight or itchy. If at all possible, avoid cleansing wipes at all costs.
If you are a regular user, parting ways with those alcohol-laden sheets of mediocrity will have immediately visible benefits. Cleansing with a wipe is the equivalent of cleaning out a deep fat fryer with a muttered prayer and a quick run over with a soiled J-Cloth. If you must use a wipe – there are occasions when it seems inevitable; hospital stays, flights and festivals to name some, invest. Estée Lauder Double Wear Long-Wear Makeup Remover Wipes (€25) are quite oily, meaning they break down makeup well while being less drying than standard wipes, and hold their moisture for a long time. They are also €25, which discourages flathúlach overuse of them. Wipes are an emergency cleanser. Sometimes, when exhausted, I’ll consider using one, but the cost will often help me drag myself to the sink.",What is considered the key to good skin and makes the most visible difference to skin texture and quality?,"The key to good skin is cleansing, which when performed correctly, makes the most visible difference to skin texture and quality."

629,"This week a man named Robert Bruss passed away. I never knew him personally but when I saw his obituary on Thursday morning I felt a real jolt of sadness. Who was this man you may ask? He was a syndicated columnist who wrote a column that was carried by the Washington Post for years called the ""Real Estate Mailbag"".
I know very little about Real Estate but when I started searching for my very first home about 5 years ago I started paying attention to his column. He was sort of the ""Dear Abby of Real Estate"". People would write him with very specific questions about home buying and he'd basically teach fundamentals. He wrote very plainly and knowledgeably and I must admit that I looked forward to reading his column long after I bought my house.
You see, there is some part of my character or personality that really, really admires excellence. When I was a kid even though I didn't really like certain sports or performances, whenever I had the chance to see someone do anything--act, sing, write, serve a volleyball, walk on a balance beam--if they were really excellent I was always thrilled and enchanted. That may be part of the reason that the people I love most in my life (such as my best friends and most certainly my wife) are really excellent at what they do. I'm just awed by people who make what would be for me, difficult things, look so easy I guess
There are a lot of people out there like Robert Bruss. And I hope that I can do a better job in my life of giving credit where credit is due before it's too late. Rest in Peace Mr. Bruss. You helped me and a lot of other people figure out what seemed unfigureoutable. Thanks. -Monica",Who was Robert Bruss and what was his contribution?,"Robert Bruss was a syndicated columnist who wrote a column called the ""Real Estate Mailbag"" for the Washington Post.

Hey Shelly, haven’t heard from you for a long time! Where have you been? Gee, these cooling & healthy drinks sound perfecr for me. Hope you’re having a wonderful day.
Blessings, Kristy
You talked me into it. I’ll pick up my 3 day cleanse on Friday morning.
I’m on Day 1 of the Raw Cooler Cleanse today. So far it’s ok, but I’ve also done Blueprint twice before!
I really want to try this, going by your review I am more willing to try it, I am a little freaked out by the GREEN MONSTER! LOL That is the only one I think I will have an issue with! I hope I can get it delivered to my area, I just have to set a date and do it, I have been eating alot healther, more fruits, veggies, mostly water and tea and smoothies to drink so hoping this helps with the cleanse.
Anyone else feel these Juices cleanses are really helping you as far as energy and your skin? I have issue with both, I am not overweight fortunatley so thats not an issue but I am always tired and I have mild acne since i was 14!
Hi Kari!
I really think it definitely helped my skin. I too suffer from mild acne and have always had to use salicylic or benzyl peroxide to keep it at bay, but I really noticed in the weeks after the cleanse ( even now) that my skin operates much better. Even in the hot NYC humidity, I haven’t had a breakout since the cleanse (of course, now that I just typed it I hope I don’t wake up to a breakout!)
Hope this works out well to you. Please let me know how you like it!
I am on day two of a five day cleanse, and I have so much energy. Here’s my take on the juices….the Green Monster is great to me. I love the hint of cucumber. All of the fruit juices such as pineapple and grapefruit mint are fabulous. The almond milk is better than the brazil nut milk. However, I could not drink the red essential or the coconut juices. I guess you can see that you have to try them for yourself because my taste buds are totally different from the reviewer. I will definitely order the custom cleanse in the future because of the customer service. They let me choose a different juice for my second shipment because I could not drink some of the juices. They have a lifetime customer!

1196,"Tummy time is recommended from birth to strengthen baby's arms, back and neck muscles and prevent the back of his head becoming flat. Jay L. Hoecker, M.D, of the Mayo Clinic, says babies should not sleep or be left unattended on tummies, but the position will help move them toward milestones of rolling and crawling. If your baby does not like lying on his tummy, there are ways you can help him learn to enjoy it.
Comfort
Make sure baby is nice and comfortable by using a soft surface like a bed and a fleecy blanket. Your baby may feel more comfortable on his tummy if you take his clothes and diaper off, making sure the room is nice and warm. This way he will not have anything pressing into his tummy and the feeling of being naked may add to his enjoyment. It is best not to make tummy time straight after a feed as his full tummy may not feel comfortable. Try to position his arms in front of him as he can eventually start to use them to lean on. Don't make tummy time too long to begin with; HealthyChildren.org advises that a newborn only needs three to five minutes two or three times a day, which can gradually be increased.
Touching
Your baby may enjoy the sensation of your fingers running gently down her back while she lies on her tummy -- this works better on bare skin. You can also stroke her cheeks, tickle her toes and gently massage her hands, feet and legs. If she is feeling a bit uncomfortable or unsure, this touching may help to put her at ease. Massage will also relax her muscles, helping her whole body feel more comfortable.
Stimulation
Keep your baby stimulated with lots of visual aids. Dr. Sears says young babies like to look at bright colors, stripes and black and white objects, so place some of these around your baby to catch his attention. Wave noisy toys, such as rattles or scrunchy toys for him to look at, or wiggle your fingers in front of him. You could also play some music during tummy time, as this sound stimulation may be another way of distracting him from any anxiety about this new position.
Interaction
Your baby loves listening to your voice, so try reclining beside her and singing or talking. You could also place her on a bed and sit on the floor so your face is level with hers. Tummy time can also work if you lie on your back with baby on her tummy on your tummy. You make a warm and soft surface, and she will love being that close to you and looking into your face. Another way of introducing tummy time is by laying her across your lap on her front.

78,"1. Alba Botanica Exfoliating Scrub
This is marketed as a facial exfoliation product, however I actually use it for my feet. I have sensitive skin, and it was causing my face to break out. I am phasing it out of my shower because it leaves large chunks of gooey-sand that dry and stick to the tub. I never seem to notice them when I’m showering, but whenever my daughters take a bath or I’m cleaning the bathtub, I really notice how much this product builds up in the tubs basin and on the ledges.
2. Aveno’s Simply Radiant
This product is amazing. It smells wonderful, leaves my face glowing, soft, and best of all feeling healthy. I usually apply this after my facial cleanse (#3). My face has never felt better!
3. Nuetrogena’s Stress Releif Acne Scrub
I have very sensitive skin and it’s been hard to find a cleanser that actually gets the job done. When things get really stressful my face tends to break out, and this scrub has been remarkable. It has stopped the breakouts and cleared up any spots of acne that have already appeared. I follow it up with a skin toner (#2).
4. Up&Up’s Soy Shave gel
This product is found exclusively at Target. You’ll hear me talk about the Up&Up brand a lot because I’m a big fan of it. They are low cost good quality products. This particular product leaves my skin smooth with a nice natural scent to follow.
5. Yardly’s Mango Shower Gel
I give this a thumbs down because while it does smell great, I am phasing it out of my shower. It doesn’t really leave a fresh feeling or fragrance behind, but rather lathers and disappears completely leaving the experience completely unmemorable. I’m still scouting for that perfect body wash that leaves my skin feeling soft and smelling good!
6. Garnier Fructis’s Sleek and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner
I have used this product for years. It smells wonderful, leaves my hair feeling healthy and strong, and best of all it doesn’t give you that waxy buildup that other products do but does give you all the shine!
7. Massagers
This are a good add to any shower, especially after a long day. Warm water and something to work out the kinks in your lower back and shoulders is just what the doctor ordered! Can usually find these in your bath isle at your local retail chains.
8. Exfoliating Glove
These are wonderful to use for your feet, elbows, knees, and any other place you get dry skin. I usually apply some body wash and work it into a lather using this glove. Goodbye dead skin, hello good feelings!
9. Munckin tub cup
This handy tub-cup is made of a very flexible rubber. This is super helpful for when you need to rinse out the shampoo from your kids hair (press the cup to their forehead and it bends to ensure water will not get into their eyes). I store mine upside down from my shower caddy to ensure it dries and does not collect mildew and standing water.
10. Crayola color-changing loufas
This is a very fun way to get your kids excited about lathering away their dirty day. These loufas change color when they heat up (from pink to white).

The 2001 hunting season was the 23rd year of our annual turkey population survey. The continuing cooperation of turkey hunters has made the survey possible. Your assistance is greatly appreciated. The information you provide is valuable in several ways.
In 2001, 493 broods were seen..96 poults seen in 2001 did not differ significantly from 7.15 the previous year. The statewide production index of poults per observer (21.34) was up slightly from last year's 18.22. The average number of poults per hen was 2.2 in 2001. An average of 3.0 or above is considered an indicator of good production. These data suggest that on a statewide basis turkey production is still somewhat depressed and can be considered at best fair, especially compared to the excellent reproduction in 1993-95. Cyclic, up-and-down trends are a natural aspect observed in wildlife populations, especially in turkeys as reproduction can be greatly affected by unpredictable, spring weather conditions. The continuing drought in Georgia can also impact reproductive success because of decreased insect production and reduced habitat quality. Managing for quality habitat should remain a priority to avoid additional limitations during seasons of low production and to take advantage of when production begins to cycle upward again. Overall, our total population is still excellent and should remain so in the foreseeable future.
This survey is conducted during the spring gobbler season with hunt data being supplied by hunter volunteers. Specific information requested about each hunting trip from our hunter cooperators is the date, hours hunted, county or region of the state hunted, the number of turkeys seen, and the number of gobblers heard. The number of gobblers killed is asked for but is optional.
The hours of hunting effort per turkey observed is used as an index of the hunting population. The correlation between this index and the production index is used in evaluating annual production and resulting hunting season populations.
Hunt information in usable form was supplied by 526 of the 2,000 hunters contacted in 2001. They reported making 4,603 trips totaling 16,883 hunting hours. The season hunting effort per cooperator was 9.0 trips totaling 32.1 hours. This is a decrease of 3 hours from the 2000 season average effort.
A total of 9,960 turkeys (hens and gobblers) were seen. The statewide population index of 1.7 hunting hours per turkey seen matched the previous year and was again among the lowest ever documented during the 21 years surveyed. The lowest effort per bird seen was in the Piedmont Plateau counties, and the greatest was in the Appalachian Highlands and Blue Ridge Mountain counties.
Cooperators reported hearing 7,374 gobblers. The hours of hunting per gobbler heard averaged 2.4 hours. Good to excellent reproductive success in 1993-95 along with an abundance of adult gobblers once again were factors contributing to the continued low hunting effort per gobbling bird in 2001. Similar to previous seasons, the least amount of time hunting per gobbler heard, 1.8 hours, was in the Piedmont Plateau, and the greatest amount of time, 5.4 hours, was in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Statewide, peak gobbling activity, 3.9 gobblers per trip, occurred during the middle of April.
The statewide harvest during the first seven days of the season accounted for 30.0% of the total season harvest. The average amount of hunting effort to kill a gobbler, 27.9 hours, increased by 1.3 hours from 2000. Statewide hunter success dropped significantly to 46.6% with 245 of the 526 cooperators taking at least one bird. Of these, 103 (42%) hunters took one bird, 79 (32.2%) took two birds, and 63 (25.7%) took three birds. Cooperators reported 42 gobblers killed by companions.
Georgia's estimated 83,923 turkey hunters had only a fair spring season in 2001 harvesting about 52,871 birds statewide. The average harvest per hunter (0.59) was down slightly from 0.63 in 2000. Across the state the 2002 spring season in general should be fair to good again depending upon the weather. Because reproduction has been down somewhat the past three years there are fewer jakes and two-year-old birds this season. However, overall the state's turkey population is still very strong. Hopefully, reproduction will rebound and the future will remain bright for Georgia's number one game bird. Good luck and good hunting.",What was the average number of poults per hen in 2001 according to the Georgia Wildlife Resources Division's survey?,The average number of poults per hen was 2.2 in 2001.
1518,"NEW YORK — As the owner of a successful acupuncture clinic in a wealthy Washington suburb, David Vandenberg never had any problems making a $433 monthly child support payment.
Until last year, when his business faltered and he went on unemployment. Unable to find another job, the 50-year-old Vandenberg moved to Arkansas to live with his parents. Now they're paying the child support for him.
""I felt I didn't have any recourse,"" said Vandenberg, who has a 12-year-old daughter and tried unsuccessfully for a court-approved reduction in his child support payments. After child support, ""I get $100 a month in unemployment."".""
The Maryland Child Support Enforcement Administration has seen an 18 percent increase over the last year in requests for child support modifications, said Paula Tolson, spokeswoman for the state Department of Human Resources.
In Prince George's County, requests have tripled over the past 1 1/2 years. While historically requests have come from custodial parents who need an increase in support, many are now coming from noncustodial parents seeking a reduction, according to Joan Kennedy, director of the county's Office of Child Support Enforcement.
Many times the custodial parent feels the hit from a downward modification. Sometimes she has experienced her own income loss.
Delaine Moore, a separated stay-at-home mom of three in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, said there have been fewer trips to the movies and McDonald's and more activities at home since her ex's oil field drilling work came to a halt in March. Her child support and spousal payments dropped from $6,500 a month to nothing. He has since picked up a part-time job earning minimum wage but is only paying $450 a month.
Moore, who blogs about motherhood, divorce and infidelity, said her parents are paying her mortgage and she had money saved, but she is considering turning her home into a day care to earn money. If things haven't improved by Christmas, she may move in with her parents.
""I think my children are still feeling very loved and most importantly I'm here for them,"" she said. But it's been stressful. ""I don't know what's going to happen.""
Child support laws vary from state to state, but the amount is primarily based on the noncustodial parent's income. Other factors include how many children there are, how much time the children spend with each parent and the custodial parent's income.
In New York, a noncustodial parent making less than $80,000 pays 17 percent — less taxes — for one child, 25 percent for two children and 29 percent for three children, plus add-ons such as child care, medical expenses and extracurricular activities. But a reduction in income is not automatic grounds for a modification, said Eyal Talassazan, a divorce attorney in Great Neck, N.Y. Courts are often reluctant to disrupt children's lives.
Family court judge Patricia Macias of El Paso, Texas, said she considers whether the parent is unemployed or underemployed by choice, is actively seeking another job and can retain a job commensurate with their education and skills. Perhaps the person has assets that can be liquidated, she said.
""I believe that family court judges as a general rule are very empathetic to the economic situation,"" said Macias, immediate past president of the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges. ""But our primary focus is what the kids need. So that it's not good enough to say, `Judge, you understand. We're in hard economic times.' We all understand but what extra effort are you making now?""
In some ways, the economy has made ex-spouses more willing to work things out on their own, said Ike Vanden Eykel of Koons, Fuller, Vanden Eykel & Robertson, a law firm with four locations in North Texas. Parents who go that route still need to get the court order changed, he said.
Samantha Land, 39, of Huntington Beach, Calif., agreed to a 50 percent reduction in $3,700 a month for her 8-year-old son.
""I don't need that much money and his income was getting reduced,"" said Land, who works as an esthetician, a nonmedical skin care specialist, and a transcriptionist. ""The funny thing is because I did that, and because I have been more agreeable he has been more willing to help me when I need help.""
Jeremy Lavine, 29, of Tampa, Fla., is keeping his two kids half the time so he is not paying the full support amount. He said he inquired about a modification more than a year ago, but the Florida Department of Children and Families told him his industry was going to bounce back.
Lavine's child support payment is still $1,100 a month based on a $4,500 a month income, though he now makes only $1,500 a month repairing jet skis. He and his ex-wife are going to mediation to get the changes to custody and child support on the books.
But as everyone knows, divorce can be contentious. Many people don't believe what their ex-spouses tell them when it comes to finances. Specialists recommend that parents work in the best interest of the children.
""Always keep talking,"" said Vanden Eykel. ""Reach an accord. These are unprecedented times. It takes a real level of cooperation to get through it.""

“ ”",What factors are considered when determining the amount of child support a noncustodial parent has to pay?,"The amount of child support a noncustodial parent has to pay is primarily based on their income. Other factors include the number of children, how much time the children spend with each parent, and the custodial parent's income."

I'll try to send invitations to contribute to those who expressed an interest, but if I don't send one to you either a) I haven't gotten to it yet or b) I don't have your (in some cases, current or preferred) email. So if you want me to do so, either leave me a comment with your email or send me an email or something. (If you know me in real life, you can send it to myfirstname@myhusband'sfirstnamelastname.com)
Here's how I see this working. Whenever you've got a recipe or cooking tip to share, you post it. Simple, huh? And make sure to tag 'cuz that'll make it easier for us all when we go looking for a recipe. Here's some tags I'm thinking would be useful in terms of general organizing of recipes. (And this is the way my box of recipe cards is organized because it's how my brain works.) (Also, yes, thank you, I already know I'm a dork.)
- Breakfast
- Breads
- Poultry
- Beef
- Pork
- Seafood
- Other Meat (like lamb, um, goat? buffalo? etc. Since I don't like seafood, my recipe box actually is ""Other Meat & Seafood,"" but I figure seafood should really get its own tag here.)
- Vegetarian Main Dishes
- Vegetable Side Dishes
- Starchy Side Dishes (you know, potatoes, rice, pasta, etc.)
- Soups With Meat
- Soups Without Meat
- Sauces & Fillings & Dips
- Desserts
- Beverages
Thoughts?

I second the appetizer category idea. I also like the veggie sorting thing, since I would like to try more veggie dishes. Especially in this first year before the kiddo can do meats.
Since we can do multiple tags per entry, could we just do a vegetarian tag? That way there would only be one Soup category, and a Main Dish category, and you can add the Vegetarian (or call it No Meat for that matter) tag when appropriate.
I like the cooking method suggestions, too!

Teeth Whitening
Get the whiter, brighter smile you want and deserve.
Get the whiter, brighter smile you want and deserve.
How often do you smile?
Think about it. Are you hiding your smile because your pearly whites aren’t so white? If you’re avoiding smiling or getting your picture taken — even during the happiest occasions — because your teeth have become stained or discolored, you’re one of many individuals unsatisfied with the appearance of their smile.
Feelings of self-consciousness about the appearance of your smile can affect your life in many ways, making everything from relationships to job interviews to simply enjoying making memories with your family and friends more difficult.
There is a way to get the whiter, brighter smile you want and deserve. We can get you smiling once again with the powerful effects of professional tooth-whitening treatments.
There are several reasons that smiles can become discolored, stained or yellowed. These include:
Considering tooth whitening? Here are a few reasons you should:
It Improves the Appearance of Your Smile. Did you know that your smile is often one of the first things that people notice about you? It’s true. A study conducted by the American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry found that 96 percent of adults think having a beautiful smile is more appealing to the opposite sex, and that more than 70 percent of adults feel as if their discolored teeth or tooth decay can have negative impacts on their career or future.
Having a dull or darkened smile may also communicate that you do not take care of your teeth and that you’re unhealthy. Having whitened teeth can communicate that you’re healthy and so is your smile.
It Boosts Your Confidence. Shying away from the camera or social situations because you’re not happy with the appearance of your smile? If so, whitening your teeth may give you the confidence boost you need and improve how you feel in social situations. You may even want to snap a selfie!
It Is Noninvasive. Whitening does not require any invasive treatment or recovery period. As an added benefit, you’ll see results quickly. It’s also affordable!
Breathe Modern Dentistry offers several high-quality options that use safe materials to combat tooth discoloration and brighten your smile.
While it can be difficult to predict how your smile will whiten because results vary from patient to patient, our tooth-whitening options have been proven to show significant benefits in comparison to other whitening treatments, including those you can purchase online or over-the-counter.
By choosing professional teeth whiteners from a dentist, you can reduce the potential for tooth sensitivity, gum irritation and other complications that over-the-counter teeth-whitening kits, whitening toothpaste or internet treatments can cause.
Yes! Many patients are concerned about their smile looking natural after whitening. We assure you that the effects of treatment will not only make your smile look whiter, but it will also look natural. Whitening your teeth does not add any unnatural color to your teeth. Instead, it bleaches surface stains, leaving you with a beautiful, natural result.

1083,"Prepare to have your breath taken away. Apple unveiled iOS 7 at its Worldwide Developers Conference today, giving the public its first official sneak peek at the massive, design-conscious overhaul coming to the mobile operating system that runs your iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. Here are the most exciting new and updated features.
An updated design
One of the first things you’ll notice about iOS 7 is that it pays an incredible amount of attention to graphic design. There are new app icons, improved typography and a minimalist approach that removes unneeded clutter, lines and color when they get in the way. The home screen is lush and vibrant, but apps like Calendar use color to help organize your life and keep your day on track. Address and search bars are hidden in Safari until you swipe to reveal them. Even the Weather app has undergone a graphic upgrade.
The new operating system uses motion sensing to create a 3D parallax illusion, making it appear as if your icons are floating above your background. It’s an absolutely unnecessary feature that is beyond gorgeous, putting an exclamation point on the operating system graphic redesign.
Notifications
Your phone’s Notification Center is getting a much-needed upgrade in iOS 7. Information is broken up into three tabs: a Today tab, which shows your calendar appointments, the current weather and even local traffic conditions; a Missed tab, which shows you all those text messages and push notifications that happened since the last time you used your phone; and an All tab, which lets you sift through every notification you received in the last 24 hours.
Control Center
In iOS 6, some of the most important phone features, such as turning on Wi-Fi and enabling Bluetooth, are hidden away in a Settings submenu. Not in iOS 7: A fully loaded Control Center can be summoned by swiping your finger up from any screen. All the important features you’re familiar with are there, as are a few new ones. Now, you can quickly access your phone’s calculator, turn on AirPlay, play and pause music–even use the new built-in flashlight feature (finally!).
Photography
Photography has always been a major part of the smartphone experience, and in iOS 7, your picture collection is getting a major update. Open the Camera app, and you’ll notice it looks a lot like Instagram, complete with eight new retro filters and an option to take square photos.
Once taken, photos are automatically organized into three groupings based on dates and locations. So a week-long trip to New York City will automatically appear in your photos as its own “Collection,” an easily found grouping of all the pictures you took while there. Inside that Collection are individual “Moments” – photos taken from the top of Rockfeller Center or shots from Central Park. You can even search your photos by year.
Multitasking
Doing more than one thing at once on a smartphone is admittedly a tall order. Apple has made strides to allow for multitasking in the past – you can use Facebook while an MP3 plays in the background, for example. But now, multitasking is built in to all iOS apps, not just a musical few. And switching between apps is easy – a simple matter of swiping your finger across the screen.
The new iOS 7 learns from how you use the phone, automatically updating apps based on your usage history. If you check your email when you wake up in the morning, your phone will learn to look for new messages immediately before you wake up. And, your phone will prioritize updates for energy efficiency, taking advantage of those moments your phone connects to Wi-Fi. In short: With iOS 7, your iPhone battery should last longer.
Find my Phone
The iPhone is a pretty popular device with tech junkies and thieves alike. With that in mind, Apple added a number of new security features that make it harder for the bad guys to sell a stolen phone and easier for you to recover yours.
Erase your phone remotely, and a lock screen message will provide good Samaritans with an alternate phone number to contact you. Erasing your phone’s memory now requires you to enter your Apple password. And, should you get your phone back after you erased it, entering your password will let you undo the damage and start restoring your phone to the way it was.
iTunes Radio
Following in the trend of copying third-party apps, Apple is introducing a Pandora-like streaming radio service this fall called iTunes Radio. The app works much the same way other streaming apps do, giving you the ability to create personalized radio stations. But, it also gives you the ability to purchase songs directly on iTunes and control the flow of music through Siri voice commands.
AirDrop
Your iPhone is finally getting the ability to share photos, videos and contacts directly with other Bluetooth-enabled devices using a feature called AirDrop. Tap the new “Share” button and you’ll be given a list of nearby devices you can securely beam your content to. No complicated setup is required, and you can easily turn off AirDrop so strangers won’t be able to see and beam questionable material to your phone.
iOS in the Car
One killer feature of iOS 7 won't be available at launch: iOS in the Car. The new functionality essentially takes your smartphone's screen and mirrors it in your car, letting you see and control music, GPS, answer phone calls and use other features all without touching your phone. A slew of major car manufacturers will be including this functionality in their 2014 models, including Chevrolet, Ferrari, Honda, Jaguar, Kia, Mercedes, Nissan, Volvo and more.
Coming this Fall
Owners of the iPhone 4, 4S, and 5 will be able to upgrade to iOS 7 for free this fall, when the new 2013 iPhone is released. Not all features will be available on some older models, due to their slower processors. The iPad 2, iPad Retina, and iPad mini will all be able to run iOS 7, as well as the iPod touch 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB.
IOS7 a reluctant love affair…
From Doug Asker on June 14, 2013 :: 5:53 am
I have already been testing iOS7 on my iPhone 5 for the last week. Being truthful I fell just a little tepid regarding the whole encounter. After years of design advancement why have Apple decided to make their OS seem like a poor relation of Microsoft’s Windows 8. On the other side it seems to have borrowed heavily from Android. Now you can swipe up to turn on/off WIFI, blue tooth, much like Android.To conclude I like: Newsstand, the integrated flashlight, screen transition, new compass interface and mail interface.
I don’t like: no bulk delete function in the mail program, it’s still message by message deletion. The pseudo windows interface and menu movement. The settings menu is a bit of a waste land of white space.
Like an aging husband and wife I am finding more faults with it as time goes on but I grow to love it the more time I spend with it.

1086,"ELIJAH AND THE WHIRLWIND
Most artists, in one way or another, through different media, like to stretch the minds of others. They are quick to delve into new areas unfamiliar to the average person. This of course holds true for anyone curious enough to look for answers to life’s mysteries, particularly our origins. When you find artists searching for truth and unable to express themselves due either to personal inabilities or censorship from their contemporaries, then you will find them incorporating their view points into their work in symbolic and sometimes discreet ways - passing along truths that cannot otherwise be mentioned without persecution. In my case it was not so much being afraid of persecution as it was having a desire to put something on canvas that would challenge others. It was an endeavor to observe reactions of those viewing the work. Most importantly, I wanted to raise the topic of UFO’s in biblical history and provoke discussion along these lines.
Well, guess what happened? Of all the people viewing the image in an exhibit, only five people asked for an explanation and I thought a couple of them would try to run me out of the state. Seriously, living in a conservative community unable to converse about these matters make me appreciate the more cosmopolitan mind that can openly discuss intellectual subjects of this nature without prejudging my own spirituality.
The title of the painting, Elijah and the Whirlwind, is based, of course, upon the incident in the old testament ( 11 Kings: 2: 1-15 ), whereas Elijah is transported to heaven in a whirlwind.
There are three very important aspects of this story. One, Elijah knows he is going on a journey. Two, he had to conform to a time schedule. And three, he had to be at a certain location by the Jordan River to be transported - almost as if he had a plane to catch.
He leaves Gilgal and goes to Bethel. From there he travels to Jericho and then to the Jordan River, all the while trying to convince Elisha to stay behind. Having arrived at his pre-determined place for departure, he finally convinces Elisha to stay behind. But, in leaving in a whirlwind, his cloak, “That fell from Him”, was taken up by Elisha. The painting depicts Elisha catching the falling cloak of Elijah. The significance of this cloak is another story.
This spacecraft is not my original design. Rather, it is based on a design, with some liberties, found on the walls of a structure excavated in 1929 by an archeological mission organized by the Vatican’s Pontifical Biblical Institute at a strategic location near the Jordan River called Tell Ghassul (Tell means mound). The building ruins date to circa 3500 BCE. “It was there that Elijah crossed the river (to its eastern bank) to keep an appointment” - quoting Zecharia Sitchin in his third book of The Earth Chronicle series, The Wars of Gods And Men, pages 180 and 190.
So, I created a craft that is maneuvered by two men (or Gods), each having an observational window. This craft could retract its landing pads, fold and secure its ‘copter’ blades, rendezvous and dock to another orbiting craft and quite possibly reduce its size a certain amount by collapsing to facilitate storage in a larger ship - note the layered body.
The legs (landing struts?), with “straight feet like the sole of a calf’s feet,” the dominant eye-like windows(?), and the helicopter-like rotaries on top were as they were depicted on the wall of a building at Tell Ghassul. I replaced a bulbous protrusion on the bottom (communication device or locking mechanism?), with a rocket cone accompanied by nozzles which made it possible to link up to a mother ship. I then added the calf-like landing pads and the rotaries on the legs. Thus, I had a hybrid-like ship drawn from biblical verse, the excellent research done by Zecheria Sitchin, and my own imagination.
Now, this is old technology, even in 1991 when the painting was done. However, scientific blasphemy and “religious heretic” will surely be cast my way. If it makes anyone a little more open to free discussion then I have succeeded. How one will judge this painting in the future is anybodies guess. Have I sent the wrong message to people? Did I stretch the truth (my truth), too much?
The danger in believing what an artist has painted is that in many cases the image is not based on thorough research and the artist can and will embellish, just as I did, some aspects or small details that are not accurate. This does not mean there is no underlying truth therein. The main point being that indeed, some type of flying machine or machines were prevalent in the Mesopotamia area during biblical times and throughout all recorded history.
The message I have presented here is that intelligent life from outside our solar system does exist. Alien intelligence was present thousands of years ago and is still with us today. That is my reality and the truth for which I search.
Unfortunately, most people don’t really care. They do not want to complicate their lives with these unexplainable truths and realities. They are like the petite lady that looked at the painting at an exhibit and then said to me, “I love the colors in that painting. They would sure look nice in my bedroom”. She paused, “If it just didn’t have that ole’ rocket ship in it”.
Alan Cornette, April, 2015",What is the title of the painting discussed in the context and what biblical event does it depict?,"The title of the painting is ""Elijah and the Whirlwind"", and it depicts the biblical event where Elijah is transported to heaven in a whirlwind."
1608,"Pete Corrie with Alvie
Just a few years ago Pete, his wife Anda and their daughter Sidonie, back then 2 1/2 years old, gave up their life in Brooklyn to make Berlin their new home. Anda, a graphic designer for Etsy.com, illustrator and all-round-DIY talent and Pete, a tattoo artist quickly fell in love with the new city. Reason enough to add to the family! Last year their son Jude Alvin was born.
Vor nicht so vielen Jahre sind Pete, seine Frau Anda und Tochter Sidonie, damals zweieinhalb Jahre alt, von Brooklyn nach Berlin gezogen. Anda, Grafikdesignerin für Etsy.com, Illustratorin und DIY-Talent und Pete, selbst erlernter Tattoo-Künstler verliebten sich schnell in die Stadt und blieben. Letztes Jahr kam Söhnchen Jude Alvin auf die Welt. Hier erzählt Pete von ihrem Leben in der deutschen Hauptstadt.
Dieses Interview ist vorerst nur auf Englisch verfügbar.
How does one become a tattoo artist?
I’m a self-taught tattoo artist. So, that means I practiced a lot on my own legs. I was also quite lucky in that pretty much as soon as I started tattooing I had plenty of people willing to let me tattoo them as well.
We see a lot of your tattoo art in the pictures above. Where do you get your inspiration from?
Wherever I find it really. Anything from folk art paintings to hand-painted signage to children’s book illustrations might make a good a tattoo. Also, old tattooists like Herbert Hoffmann, Stoney St. Clair and Lee Roy Menugh have great style. Right now I’m obsessed with this book Mauvais Garçons that is pictures of French penal colony tattoos from around the turn of the 20th century. Really tough stuff.
When are your kids allowed to get their first tattoo ?
I get this question a lot. Almost as often as: “Have you ever tattooed your kids?” Of course I haven’t! But, I have designed temporary tattoos. I gave some to our daughter, Sidonie, for Christmas last year.
Anda, your wife, designs her own fabric and sews clothes for your kids. You both are super creative parents…What do you plan for Alvis first birthday party?
Alvie’s first birthday is going to be “Thumbs Up!” themed, since when counting on the hand in Germany one uses the thumb as “one”. In the states we use the first finger. His birthday is only a few days before mine, so I think this year I might not get much of a party myself, but that’s OK.
Why did you decide to live in Berlin? Something about the US that you miss?
We came to Berlin about 4 years ago. Berlin has tons of parks, good schools, good vibes and decent Mexican food. It’s also a major European capital city that is still affordable and welcomes people from all over the world. It’s pretty much perfect. I love it here, I hope we never go back! Just kidding. I miss family and friends back stateside but I don’t miss living there. Too hectic.
Last June the second child, Alvie, was born. How is family life with the second one?
We’re a square now, no longer a triangle. It’s a big change but Sidonie, who is 6 now, is an awesome big sister. She helps out a bit, feeding him some food or just entertaining him while we work on something else. But now when Anda or I want to give each other a break we know the other will have two to deal with.
How do you guys manage to get some couple time?
Well, we share a studio at home and spend time there together almost every night. It’s great. We were both very productive this winter. I’m hoping that Alvie will be ready for a babysitter before fall so Anda and I can enjoy some summer nights in the Bier Garten, ohne Kindern.
What’s the best advice parents-to-be can get?
Remember to sleep. Trade off mornings with your partner so one of you can always sleep in. Also, travel as much as you can in the first few years. Infants are great travelers.
What’s the hardest about being a dad?
In a lot of ways my life is much easier now that I’m a father. I mean, sure, there’s a lot more to think about and coordinate, balancing work and play and life and love but I like that. Things can get monotonous when all you do is make art, skate, work a bit, drink coffee and tattoo. But real talk, living overseas has made me really aware of how much easier life is with family around. So I am very thankful living with Anda and the kids.
What’s the greatest?
Kids. Kids are the greatest.
Thank you Pete!

1415,"If there’s a genus we love more than or equal to Liopropoma here at Reef Builders, it’s got to be Plectranthias. Unfortunately, Plectranthias is poorly reviewed and the genus is riddled with numerous undescribed members which leads to confusion in identifying various species. To make matters worse, it is not uncommon for certain unknown species to look similar to known ones, or even unknown ones looking similar to other unknown ones. Such confusion is rampant and is a great cause for headaches.
Plectranthias is distributed aggressively in all major oceans in the Pacific, Indian as well as the Atlantic. The genus attains maximum development in the Pacific where a majority of the species are found. A large handful of known unknowns are documented and are awaiting description, but it is with certainty that even more remain to be discovered. Their highly cryptic and coy behaviour protects them from observation and capture. Many of them are also adept at living in deepwater, which makes documentation even more obscure.
In Japan alone, at least four or more undescribed species can be found. One of them, pictured here, can be found outside of Japan as well with a big range encompassing Indonesia and the Philippines as well. It can also be found in Papua New Guinea and Palau, where it is abundant below 300ft. Because there are so many undescribed species without names, allocating even a common name for this or even a temporary number is difficult.
This particular undescribed species is a known unknown, and is quite frequently photographed in Japan. This species is best characterised by its network of rust coloured hieroglyphic markings, which includes a variably sized spot on the body. Dorsal spines 1-4 are coloured prominently in white, with the rest being clear. The large spot pattern on its body is unique to this and only one other species**, for which it is also undescribed and sometimes confused with.
This species is rare in the trade, but very uncommonly makes its appearance randomly and unexpectedly. It can be found in Indonesia, and Luiz Rocha reports this to be common in the Philippines as well. The single specimen headlining this post showed up in Bangkok, Thailand, and was photographed by Ohm Pavaphon.
Take note that in that specimen, the spot on the body is very large and prominently distinct from the other markings on the body. According to the shop where the fish came from, it was exported out of Irian Jaya, but exactly where we are unsure.
**As mentioned before the former undescribed species shares the spot characteristic with one other member. The “Hinomaru” Plectranthias from Japan is also currently undescribed, and shared the same characteristic of having a large red circular blotch on its body. However this species is more consistent in its marking, and the circle is always roughly the same size in varying examples.
The name “Hinomaru” comes from the red circle in the Japanese flag, which gives this species its name. Unlike the former, the “Hinomaru” Plectranthias lacks the rust coloured markings, but instead, have a series of striae that are composed of gold scaling edged in orange. The dorsal spines are also entirely clear and are not marginally edged in white. The Bishop Museum drew similarities between both undescribed members, so it is with hope that they eventually get a name soon.",Where is the Plectranthias genus most developed and where are the majority of its species found?,The Plectranthias genus is most developed and the majority of its species are found in the Pacific.

An interesting selection. I have all three of the poetry books, so shall have to sit down and reread them. I don’t have Selina’s book, although it’s been on my books-to-investigate list for a while now.
I think though that it’s a pity they don’t have a shortlist for Best First Book – and not just because it might have given me hope for a few months longer (I’ll though I’ll admit an element of that … sigh!). But it would have been interesting to know who made the shortlist, and who else was considered. Something to talk about. An acknowledgement that there was more than one book in the running. On the other hand, it does mean that three first time authors get an extra two month of celebrating …
So, who do you think should win? Do any of the choices surprise you? Please you? Irritate you? And what is it about the South Island that produces so many fabulous writers?
Sorry you didn’t make it babe – I mean, Joanna. Well done the Mainland, though, and huge ups for your generous post. I will have to read these books now – I have, to my shame, read none of them, although I have a couple there on the PILE to read…. looking at them now.
Well, she says stoutly, I think you should be in the running–but I am rather partisan! 🙂 Although all 3 of the finalists have strong claims, as well (I can actually put my hand on my heart and say that I have read them all!)
I haven’t read Selina’s book yet … but Ruth Todd at Women on Air tells me she really enjoyed it. Will have to put it on the pile now.
I agree with you about no shortlist for the new poets: I really think that’s a fizz, especially as it was the new poets that I enjoyed reading and interviewing most last year.
I will keep my fingers crossed that the Mary Gilmore Prize in Aus comes through for you and The Summer King–and most deservedly imho.
I also am very sad about the demise of the best first book shortlists. I’d only just really noticed their existence, and they were gone again. I thought they were a really nice way of giving a bit extra attention to a few newer writers. The whole awards seems such a pinched affair this year, with only four categories and not many books in each.
Sorry that you didn’t make the shortlist. There’s no accounting for taste.
I agree, too, that it would have been good to have a shortlist for Best First Book, it is great to have several new writers to explore. I enjoyed The Lustre Jug, but not as much as Bernadette’s previous book, The Ponies – I could never fathom why that one missed the shortlist. I also have Michael Harlow’s book but I haven’t read Brian Turner’s yet. Loved Limestone, and have been thinking of reading As the Earth Turns Silver, but I already have a big pile of unread books and not enough time 😦",Who won the NZSA Jessie Mackay Award for Best First Book of Poetry in 2010?,Selina Tusitala Marsh won the NZSA Jessie Mackay Award for Best First Book of Poetry in 2010.
1674,"Foxtrot Delta is a fun and unique edutainment game that teaches kids about Australia geography and history, as well as medical facts about major diseases. The game casts you as a doctor/pilot working for Australia's Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS), a wonderful airborne medical service founded by Reverend John Flynn in 1928. As a flying doctor, your job is to help prevent outbreak of deadly diseases by tracking down the carrier to the right location in Australia, diagnose the disease, and administer the correct antidote.
The game plays like a combination of Carmen Sandiego and the diagnosis portion of Life & Death. Once you receive an urgent radio message from the RFDS, you must take off in your plane (named ""Foxtrot Delta,"" hence the game's name), travel to the right location, and start interviewing the locals to track down the disease carrier. In the process, you will learn snippets on the history and cultures of various cities in Australia. The diagnosis part of the game is simpler than in Life & Death, although you still need to remember salient facts and select the right antidote.
Foxtrot Delta is overall an interesting and unique title that manages to teach several subjects in the same program. It is not as varied or graphically appealing as Gumboots Australia or Bushbuck Charms, Reckon's two other major education games, but it is still worth a look. It is also worth noting - and applauded - that portion of the proceeds from the sale of this game was donated to the RFDS. This is a great idea, and definitely should inspire more game companies to follow suit.

A new chapter in green racing revved up this past weekend at the Rolex 24 at Daytona. The endurance race was the first race of the TUDOR United SportsCar Championship and was sanctioned by the International Motor Sports Association (IMSA). In a signing ceremony at the Daytona International Speedway, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Michael Carr, and IMSA President, Scott Atherton, announced a five-year partnership that will build on the success of the previous five years of putting advanced vehicle technologies on the racetrack through the Green Racing initiative.
Developed and sponsored by the Energy Department, the Environmental Protection Agency, SAE International (one of the nation’s leading transportation engineering associations), and several automotive industry leaders, Green Racing aims to leverage the technology innovation of the racing community to develop and transfer cleaner, more efficient fuels and vehicle technologies to consumer vehicles.
All of the teams competing in the TUDOR Championship Grand Tour Le Mans class, which features commercially available vehicle technologies, have chosen to use E85 (fuel that is 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline). Using this alternative fuel reduces the petroleum the vehicles consume by 62% and the greenhouse gas emissions they produce by 65%, compared to the previously-used oil-based fuels.
“If racing Corvettes and Ferraris are performing well on E85, then you better believe it’s good for consumers [with flexible-fuel vehicles] to use in their cars,” Atherton said at Rolex 24.
At the end of this year’s season, teams in the TUDOR Championship that go the farthest and the fastest with the smallest environmental footprint will win the Green Racing Challenge award. These teams will serve as a model for sustainable transportation and prove that energy efficient vehicle technologies are capable of high performance in extreme racing conditions.
Green Racing is one of many Energy Department efforts to make motorsports more sustainable. The Energy Department and NASCAR recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding to find ways to further incorporate transformative clean energy technologies into NASCAR operations.

600,"The Minnesota Wild have a winger. The winger is big, skilled, leads the team in points, leads the team in goals, drives puck possession and does all that against solid opposition.
The problem is that the winger is Dany Heatley.
Heatley was acquired from the San Jose Sharks in the offseason specifically to revert to his 40-goal form and lead a postseason run; instead, the Minnesota Wild, after a hot start had them atop the Western Conference as late as Dec. 18, have crashed and burned out of the postseason picture.
Heatley, 31, arrived in Minnesota via a one-for-one July trade with the Sharks that sent winger Martin Havlat to San Jose. Coming off a 26-goal second season for the Sharks that ended with a loss in the Western Conference finals, Heatley was determined to more resemble the guy that had back to-back 50-goal seasons for the Ottawa Senators in 2005-06 and 2006-07.
Heatley, who was born in Germany while his father played professionally there and holds dual Canadian and German citizenship, expected it. The Wild expected it.
""As a goal scorer and a player, you want to be that guy,"" Heatley told reporters after the trade.
In 2010-11, he struggled with several injuries and stayed in the lineup for more than a month with a broken hand.
""Last year wasn't the greatest year for me personally, but I'm looking forward to getting back there,"" Heatley said.
Wild GM Chuck Fletcher acquired Heatley, along with winger Devin Setoguchi in a separate trade with San Jose, to pump up an offense that, in 2010-11, simply didn't get the puck on net enough—they ranked last in the NHL in shots (26.2 per game) and 26th in goals (2.48 per game).
""Our lack of goal-scoring is well documented. Our inability to shoot the puck is well documented,"" Fletcher said after the trade. ""We've acquired two players who are able to complement the players on our team real well.""
While Heatley hasn't been bad—again, 20-goal forwards with his peripheral stats don't exactly grow on trees—he simply hasn't done what Fletcher openly believed he would.
Minnesota remains, to its detriment, a low shot-volume team, and its success at the beginning of the season has been increasingly exposed as a mirage. Statistically oriented observers called it out, based on the fact that teams that shoot as little as the Wild do not score enough goals to win enough games to truly contend.
When Heatley scored his 20th goal of the season on March 1, the Wild were in their customary position: last in goal-scoring and last in shots per game. It wasn't until three weeks later that Heatley netted his 21st goal of the season, on Thursday against Calgary. Three weeks later, not much has changed; Minnesota remains the league's worst offensive team, though center Mikko Koivu's pending return should help matters.
The issue is a familiar one for anyone who has tracked Heatley's career: How much personal blame does he bear for his team's failings? In the past, that question has taken a different form—with the Sharks and Senators, Heatley was, in some respects, expected to win titles. With the Wild, the expectation was that he'd help them make the postseason for the first time since 2008. And despite the volatile nature of the Western Conference playoff picture, that's not going to happen in 2012.
Heatley's individual lack of production this season lies mainly in a low shooting percentage. His 9.5 mark represents a career low and the continuation of a downward trend that began in 2007-08 with the Senators, when his percentage went from a career-high 18.3 to 15.1. At that point, the drop was on: He went from 15.1 to, in his first season with San Jose after demanding a trade, 13.9. Then he went from 13.9 to 12.0 in 2010-11.
The Wild, though, are playing Heatley against significantly more difficult even-strength competition than he'd faced with the Sharks, who used other forwards, like Joe Pavelski and Logan Couture, against better opponents.
Using behindthenet.ca's Corsi QualComp stat, which measures shots (including those blocked and missed) directed at the attacking net, subtracted by all those attempted on the defensive net, Heatley has faced the second-most difficult even-strength competition among Minnesota's forwards and 10th-most difficult competition of all NHL forwards with at least 50 or more games played in 2011-12.
In his last season with the Sharks, Heatley's QualComp ranking: sixth among San Jose's forwards and 280th overall. Given that, and the fact that he generates more shots than any other member of the Wild, he remains an objectively useful player and has, in a few ways, been better this season than last.
That's still a departure from Heatley's stated goal in the fall, when he was open about his desire to show that he was still capable of scoring at an elite level and, implicitly, earning his elite paycheck; his $7.5 million cap hit, which runs through the 2013-14 season, is tied with four others for the seventh-largest in the NHL.
""I hate talking like that, like, 'I'm so motivated,'"" Heatley told the Minneapolis Star Tribune in early October. ""You ever watch (HBO's) '24/7' where the boxer's like, 'I'm so motivated, I'm in the best shape of my life?' and then the champ knocks him out in the first round?""
""But yeah, inside me, there's definitely that. You want to prove to everybody, and to your new teammates, and to your new city and fans, that you're the same player you always were.""
For the Wild, the question is whether the player he's become, and the player they've put him in position to be, is enough.",Who did the Minnesota Wild acquire from the San Jose Sharks?,The Minnesota Wild acquired Dany Heatley from the San Jose Sharks.
1037,"Panic! at the Disco at the Hammersmith Apollo
Panic! At the Disco have won us over from the start. Since their formation in 2004 and release of A Fever You Can’t Sweat Out, we couldn’t get enough of their poppy, electric dance punk sound, Brendon Urie’s delicious vocals and their vaudeville style – and neither could the rest of the world.
The debut album went double platinum in the US, sold 2.2 million copies worldwide and resulted in an extensive world tour. The boys followed up their success with the equally sensational Pretty Odd in 2008, which gave us hit singles Nine in the Afternoon and That Green Gentleman. Having recently released their fourth album Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!, the threesome played a much awaited show at Hammersmith Apollo as part of The Gospel Tour – and what a show it was…
There was an incredible atmosphere inside the Apollo as spotlights darted through the crowd, smoke cannons exploded and frontman Brendon burst on to the stage opening the set with Vegas Lights to the passionate screaming of teenage girls (and boys). To our delight, the band played all of our old favourites right from where their music began. We danced along to But It’s Better If You Do and Lying Is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off like we were 14 again, and the crowd showed equal approval to the fresher material such as the new single This Is Gospel, which we adore. The crowd were mesmerised by Urie not just for his remarkable vocals, but also for his eccentric charm and stage presence.
After their set the band returned for an encore which ended with I Write Sins Not Tragedies (what else?!) raising the roof of the Apollo. We write this suffering with post-gig blues after a sensational night which proved that ten years on, P!ATD are still very much the here and now.

301,"Are there gaps in your smile? According to the American Academy of Implant Dentistry, “35 million Americans are missing all their teeth in one or both jaws,” with many more missing one or a few teeth. Living with gaps in your smile can be embarrassing, uncomfortable, and unhealthy. Your teeth are fundamental to your quality of life—you can’t eat, chew, speak, or smile easily without them. Furthermore, if you don’t replace missing teeth, this can lead to a cascade of other oral health issues, as you mouth and jaws adjust to try and fill the space left behind.
In the past, the only solution to missing teeth were restorations like dentures, bridges, and crowns that sat on top of your gums. While they can be beautiful and effective, they do have their downsides. Fortunately, modern technology has revolutionized restorative dentistry for people with missing teeth. At Dr. Cindy Flanagan’s Houston practice, we often assist patients using dental implants. While you’ve likely heard this term in advertisements, from friends, or even at our office, you may not know exactly what dental implants are. That’s why we’ve made this week’s blog post all about dental implants! Read on to learn more about this state-of-the-art tooth technology.
Dental Implants 101
What makes dental implants different from other restorations is the way they’re held in place. As we mentioned above, regular prostheses sit above the gums. Dental implants, on the other hand, are firmly attached to your actual jawbone, just as a natural tooth would be. This is because implant technology replaces not just the tooth, but the tooth’s root. According to WebMD, “dental implants are replacement tooth roots. Implants provide a strong foundation for fixed (permanent) or removable replacement teeth that are made to match your natural teeth.” Dental implants are titanium posts inserted into your jawbone, where they integrate with your existing tissue. Once the posts are placed, we can simply attach any kind of prosthesis to them.
Do You Qualify?
You may be eligible for dental implants if:
- You are missing one or more teeth.
- You have one or more teeth that require extraction. This could be due to injury, fracture, severe decay, gum disease, or some other issue.
- You are in good general health, since the placement of one or more dental implants is a surgical procedure.
- You are in excellent oral and dental health. If you suffer from decay or gum disease, we will need to treat your condition before providing dental implants.
- You have sufficient jawbone tissue for dental implants. Since implants are placed within and fuse to the jawbone, it’s important that you have enough jawbone material to hold them. If you do not, you may be able to undergo a preparatory procedure to help you qualify for dental implants.
Dr. Flanagan will examine your mouth, go over your records, discuss the procedure with you, take X-rays, and perform any other needed diagnostic tests to determine if you are a good candidate for dental implants.
Benefits of Dental Implants
There are numerous advantages to restoring your smile with sophisticated implant technology. Dental implants can improve your:
- Comfort. Regular restorations, particularly dentures, can shift around in your mouth, irritating your gums and knocking against any remaining teeth. Dental implants are designed like a natural tooth, stable and secure.
- Oral health. Dental implants hold prostheses to your jawbone, rather than securing them with surrounding teeth. WebMD explains: “dental implants don’t require reducing [shaving down] other teeth, as a tooth supported bridge does. Because nearby teeth are not altered to support the implant, more of your own teeth are left intact, improving long-term oral health. Individual implants also allow easier access between teeth, improving oral hygiene.” In addition to these important factors, dental implants are durable, so you’ll have to undergo fewer treatments to keep them in good shape.
- Ability to eat. Regular restorations can move around in your mouth when you try to eat. They may even loosen or fall out if you eat more chewy, sticky, hard, or otherwise difficult foods. You don’t have to worry about this with dental implants.
- Appearance. Dental implants feel more like teeth within your mouth, and they also look natural, especially with our beautiful crowns, bridges, and dentures.
- Speech. Typical restorations can slide around in your mouth as you talk, making it more difficult to enunciate clearly. This is not the case with dental implants, since these are rooted to your jawbone.
- Quality of life. All of the above benefits make your day-to-day activities easier, allowing you to relax and enjoy your life more.
Dr. Flanagan can go over more specific advantages of dental implants for your particular case at your initial consultation for dental implants.

Biomechanical modeling of the facial soft tissue behavior is needed in aesthetic or maxillo-facial surgeries where the simulation of the bone displacements cannot accurately predict the visible outcome on the patient's face. Because these tissues have different nature and elastic properties across the face, depending on their thickness, and their content in fat or muscle, individualizing their mechanical parameters could increase the simulation accuracy. Using a specifically designed aspiration device, the facial soft tissues deformation is measured at four different locations (cheek, cheekbone, forehead, and lower lip) on 16 young subjects. The stiffness is estimated from the deformations generated by a set of negative pressures using an inverse analysis based on a Neo Hookean model. The initial Young's modulus of the cheek, cheekbone, forehead, and lower lip are respectively estimated to be 31.0 kPa ± 4.6, 34.9 kPa ± 6.6, 17.3 kPa ± 4.1, and 33.7 kPa ± 7.3. Significant intra-subject differences in tissue stiffness are highlighted by these estimations. They also show important inter-subject variability for some locations even when mean stiffness values show no statistical difference. This study stresses the importance of using a measurement device capable of evaluating the patient specific tissue stiffness during an intervention

We would like to thank the many veterinarians from the Bellingham area who attended our neurology seminar on Wednesday February 25th. Dr. Gordon spoke about seizure activity in companion animals as well as about intervertebral disc disease.
This continuing education seminar was organized by the Tri-County Veterinary Medical Association and took place at Bellingham Technical College. The college’s culinary department prepared a delicious buffet for guests which kept us going back for more!
Dr. Gordon feels that neurology might not be as exciting for everyone as it is for himself but the humorous side of him makes up for it in a big way. Dr. Gordon thoroughly enjoyed engaging with his audience until late that evening.
As we are only about 20 minutes from the border, we often see patients from Washington State that require specialty services offered by BBVSH. It was a great pleasure for Dr. Gordon to be able to meet some of the referring veterinarians from just across the line.

1281,"This is a bit long. It's another of my HistoNet replies that says, ""You must know what you're using, because if you don't you might end up in the brown & sticky."" What is Penfix? If it's different from formaldehyde it will probably have different effects on the structure of cells and other parts of the tissue, and on the results obtained with different staining methods. It is important to know what you are working with, and how it works. Formaldehyde has many faults and is rarely used correctly (especially in busy pathology labs), but its actions are pretty well understood, and its shortcomings should be easily recognized by the person examining the stained slides. The same is true of the ingredients of other fixatives that have been around for many years. I'm not claiming that all older fixatives are good; many of them are much worse than formalin. My point is that it's essential to know what the fixative does to the tissue. No other part of the processing procedure has a greater effect on the fine structure or on staining properties with dyes, antibodies etc. Does the label on the Penfix bottle tell you what's in it, and how much of each ingredient? If it does, you're paying for someone else to mix it instead of making your own - nothing wrong with that if you've got the money. If the ingredients are a trade secret can you ever justify using it? No good journal would accept a paper when the results had been influenced by some mixture whose composition was unknown to the authors. And imagine the pathologist, being sued for a wrong diagnosis, explaining to the judge that ""No, your honour, I don't know whether I'd have got it right after formalin or Bouin. We were trying this new stuff that the sales rep said was better ..."" There is an intermediate condition, where a fixative mixture is semi-secret, with the active ingredients revealed and their mode(s) of action explained by the manufacturer, but without enough information about concentrations or minor components to allow a lab worker to make the stuff from scratch. Anatech's ""Prefer"" is an example of this type. The rationale and principal ingredient are adequately explained but the MSDS sheet makes it quite clear that the detailed composition is an undisclosed trade secret. Some ""proprietary"" zinc-formaldehyde mixtures may also come in this category but in this case there is no shortage of published mixtures, including one from 1895 that's only 2 or 3 years younger than the first use of formaldehyde in microtechnique. Please not that this is not an attack on Penfix, which I hadn't heard of before the recent exchange of HistoNet emails. It may well be an excellent product, and if its manufacturers monitor this newsgroup they will surely send us an account of what their product is. I hope they'll also send something to a peer-reviewed journal. Proper publication could only help their cause and increase their sales. John A.

2103,"Ron Amadeo has probably made his last APK teardown at Android Police since he's moving to Ars Technica but luckily the teardowns won't stop and we'll keep having juicy info on the stuff that Google hides in their app updates.
Ron tore down the newest Google Glass update, version XE8, and found some interesting things that could be in added soon to the augmented reality glasses. Let's take a look what he found hidden inside.
Google Hangouts
Google introduced Hangouts at Google I/O earlier this year and slowly the company is removing every competing product and giving Hangouts a central position in every service. Now it seems that Hangouts are making their way into Glass and some code has appeared on the XE8 update for Glass.
Screen Lock
Right now Glass isn't too secure, there's no security or unlock code to it, you just use it and that's it. Of course, since the device is always tethered to your phone, once it's separated enough from it the device pretty much becomes useless. Also, Google would just deactivate the device if someone tries to pair it with a new unregistered account.
The new update has a working lock screen feature, which is still a sort of lab experiment as it's not completed, that allows you to set a ""pattern"" lock to your Glass. What you do is record four interactions with the trackpad in a certain order which are shown to you by a screen with 4 rows and 3 positions for dots in each row. A swipe left puts a dot on the left, swipe right on the right and a tap puts one in the center. The device will stay unlocked until you remove it from your head which is pretty cool.
Finally, Amadeo found that the Google Glass team likes to troll people by leaving this line in the code: ""I_TORE_DOWN_THIS_APK_AND_ALL_I_GOT_WAS_THIS_STUPID_LAB."" It could be for anyone, but I think it seems pretty much aimed specifically at him.
Hangouts will probably be added soon to Glass while the Lock Screen might need more work before it's ready, right now isn't very secure with just 81 combinations, meaning the device could be cracked in about 2 or 3 minutes.","What new features were found in the Google Glass update, version XE8, according to Ron Amadeo's teardown?","Ron Amadeo found that Google Hangouts are making their way into Glass and some code has appeared on the XE8 update for Glass.

History
Ultraman Cosmos
Long ago in the past, Planet Srayu was a utopia, a planet with no armies that enjoyed a time of peace. However this peace was destroyed by invaders who attacked the planet. Afterwards the people of Srayu decided that any planet that was deemed a potential threat to them would be destroyed. Discovering Earth, they sent Lamia, a representative for them to brought the planet annihilating robot Guinje to Earth. Upon arrival, the SHARKS attack force attacked Guinje, the UFO vanished but not before it dropped an escape pod that contained an unconscious Lamia. While under the care of SRC, Lamia awoke a week later and escaped. Seeing the heavy military presence in the city, she deemed Earth a threat. When she tried to activated Guinje, a group of youngsters stole the key from her and ran away while unintentionally activating the robot killer. It emerged from a building where it was camouflaged and transformed into robot mode. The robot was proven a challenge as it could withstand the combined assault from Team EYES, SHARK forces and Ultraman Cosmos. Doctor Noboru returned the key to her and asked the alien to deactivate the robot but only for his words to fall on deaf's ears. The military forces approached the girl, as one of them accidentally fired a pistol but Dr. Noboru took the bullet instead to defend Lamia. Witnessing the doctor's bravery in saving her, Lamia embraced and healed him, changing her view towards mankind and deactivated Guinje then departed away from Earth.

826,"COLUMBIA, S.C. -- It wound up not being as pretty as it could've been and it required a spark from some different faces, but LSU turned things around Saturday. And no matter how harrowing it might've gotten in the closing minutes, there was still an audible sigh of relief as the Tigers walked off the court at South Carolina.
LSU broke up a back-and-forth battle with the young and feisty Gamecocks by cranking up its defense from start to finish and finding some timely touch from 3-point range in a 71-68 victory at the Colonial Life Center.
The Tigers (10-4, 1-1 SEC) weathered a late charge from USC (7-8, 0-2), which scored 9 unanswered points after falling behind by 14 points to claw within 64-59 with 2:12 to go.
Survival became the key after that, and LSU did by making just enough free throws - 7 of 13 in the last 1:10 - and not letting up defensively or on the backboards, where the Tigers seized 42-32 advantage.""It was a grinding game,"" LSU coach Johnny Jones after his team avoided an 0-2 SEC start for the second year in a row.
""I thought it was a great team effort.""
A different-looking team for sure.
Following a 68-50 blowout loss to Tennessee last Tuesday, Jones spent the week tweaking his team and making players re-establish their roles. The result was a new-look starting five, with senior Shavon Coleman and sophomore Malik Morgan stepping in for Jarell Martin and Andre Stringer.
Those two combined for LSU's first 9 points and were also tone-setters on defense and on the backboards.
Late in the game, Morgan connected on 2-of-4 foul shots in the last 22.9 seconds to finally secure the victory. Carolina's Brenton Williams hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer for the final difference.
The loss snapped a two-game swoon and put the Tigers in the SEC win column for the first time this season.""It was a little early to say this was a must-win for us,"" said Morgan, who scored 8 points, snatched 6 rebounds, recorded a team-high 4 assists and even blocked a pair of shots. ""But we also knew it was big for us to get headed back in the right direction.""
Martin led LSU with a career-best 18 points, and the inside tandem of Johnny O'Bryant and Jordan Mickey came alive in the second half with 9 and 8 points, respectively.
Getting that inside duo revved up was what finally triggered the burst when the Tigers grabbed control.
Eight minutes into the second half, the game was deadlocked, 42-42 as both teams grappled with turnovers and poor shooting - a result of stingy defense on both ends of the floor.
Right after Williams made a pair of free throws, LSU's backcourt players started feeding the two big men inside.
Morgan fed Mickey on a back-in move when he simply overpowered South Carolina's Michael Carerra. Then O'Bryant scored on a nice baseline drive. Mickey grabbed a pass from O'Bryant on a high-low feed and scored inside. Moments later, the talented freshman swished a jumper from the lane. And finally, O'Bryant finished off a 10-3 haymaker by facing up and nailing a 12-foot shot.
""It's good when we have that kind of success because it opens things up for Andre and Shavon on the outside,"" said Mickey, who scored 13 points, buoyed by 6-of-10 shooting from the floor.""
Did it ever.
With the Gamecocks unable to contain Mickey and O'Bryant (13 points, 4-of-9 FG, 7 rebounds), Carolina coach Frank Martin put his team in a 2-3 zone - which made sense because the Tigers were 2-of-12 from 3-point range at that point.
Finally, though, LSU's shooters connected from deep to complete the turnaround.
Stringer sprinted to the left corner on a set play, gathered in a spot-on pass from Morgan and jacked in a trey to give the Tigers their first double-digit lead, 55-45 with 8:10 to go. Moments later, O'Bryant handled a double-team perfectly and fed Tim Quarterman and Stringer on back-to-back possessions for 3-pointers to swell the lead to 63-50 and the Gamecocks never climbed completely back.
Not that they faded quietly in front of a spirited crowd of 12,071.After falling into a 64-50 hole, Carolina kept chipping away - aided by LSU's inability to hit shots from point-blank range and from the foul stripe. The Tigers went 4:34 between scoring and didn't make a shot from the field in the last 6:01.
Meanwhile, Sindarius Thornwell kept attacking and scored 4 of his season-high 25 points to fuel the 9-0 surge. Moments later, Williams buried a 3-pointer to slice the Tigers' lead to 66-62 with 54 seconds to play.
Unlike several games earlier this season, LSU held on, this time with sticky defense and offensive rebounding as the difference-maker. Mickey and Morgan came up with two of the Tigers' 14 steals in the closing minute and O'Bryant corralled a pair of key offensive caroms on missed free throws.
""We weren't great offensively after we got the big lead,"" Jones said. ""Shots didn't go, but we were able to make it up on the other end of the floor with hustle plays on defense and getting stops when we needed them.""
Which added up to what LSU needed most of all.
""We had to get back on the right path,"" Coleman said. ""We're too talented and have too many goals to reach to not play better than win games.""
The Tigers are back in action Wednesday when they travel to Ole Miss.
